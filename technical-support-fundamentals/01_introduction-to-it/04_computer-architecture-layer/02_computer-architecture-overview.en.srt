00:00:11,913 --> 00:00:15,978
In the last video I mentioned that people
don't need to understand how a computer

2
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:20,390
works for them to use it, because
abstraction makes things simpler for us.

3
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,300
That's technically true, but since
you're stepping into the world of IT,

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:27,990
you do need to understand all the layers
of a computer and how they work.

5
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,220
It's essential that you understand
how the different pieces interact so

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,445
you can resolve any issue that may arise.

7
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:36,417
For the rest of this course we'll
deep dive into the layers of

8
00:00:36,417 --> 00:00:40,045
computer architecture, and learn all
the parts that make up a computer.

9
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:43,147
A computer can be cut into
four main layers, hardware,

10
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:46,000
operating system, software, and users.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,710
The hardware layer is made up of
the physical components of a computer.

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,140
These are objects you can
physically hold in your hand.

13
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,570
Laptops, phones, monitors,
keyboards, you get the idea.

14
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,630
In the next lesson you'll learn all
of the components of the computer and

15
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,832
how they work.

16
00:01:00,832 --> 00:01:04,080
You'll even be able to build your own
computer by the end of this module.

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,540
The operating system allows hardware
to communicate with the system.

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,610
Hardware is created by many
different manufacturers.

19
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,630
The operating system allows them
to be used with our system,

20
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,020
regardless of where it came from.

21
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,150
In the next few lessons, you'll learn
about the major operating systems

22
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,670
that we use today, and
you'll be able to understand

23
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,930
all of the underlying components
that make up an operating system.

24
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,580
By the end of these lessons, you'll have
a strong grasp on the major components of

25
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,740
any operating system,
like Android or Windows, and

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,790
use that knowledge to navigate
any operating system.

27
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,960
The software layer is how we as
humans interact with our computers.

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,360
When you use a computer, you're given a
vast amount of software that you interact

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,620
with, whether it's a mobile app,
a web browser, a word processor,

30
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,040
or the operating system itself.

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,660
Later in this course, we'll learn how
software is installed on our systems, and

32
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,240
how we interact with
different types of software.

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,230
The last layer may not seem like
it's part of the system, but

34
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,120
it's an essential layer of
the computer architecture, the user.

35
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,590
The user interacts with the computer and
she can do more than that.

36
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:10,180
She can operate, maintain, and
even program the computer.

37
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,690
The user layer is one of the most
important layers we'll learn about.

38
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,910
When you step into the field of IT,
you may have your hands full with

39
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,800
the technical aspects, but the most
important part of IT is the human element.

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,800
While we work with computers every day, it
is the user interaction that makes up most

41
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,850
of our job, from responding to user
emails to fixing their computers.

42
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,880
By the end of the course,

43
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,020
you'll also learn how to apply your
knowledge of how a computer works

44
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,680
to fix real world issues that can
sometimes seem random and obscure.

45
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,910
We'll do this by learning how to utilize
problem solving tactics to identify

46
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,350
issues and solutions.

47
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,770
There's a lot ahead.

48
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:49,830
The next instructor you're going to
meet is a friend of mine, Devon.

49
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:53,080
And I know there's no better person
to teach you about hardware.

50
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,355
He'll even show you how to build
a computer from its component parts,

51
00:02:56,355 --> 00:02:57,810
pretty cool.

52
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,143
But before you get to building that
computer, we've got a quiz coming up for

53
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:02,251
you on binary counting.
