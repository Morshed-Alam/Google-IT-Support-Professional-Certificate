1
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,160
When you hear the word computer,

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,108
maybe you think of something like a beefy gaming desktop with flashing lights,

3
00:00:17,108 --> 00:00:19,245
or maybe you think of a slim and sleek laptop.

4
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:23,565
These fancy devices aren't what people had in mind when computers were first created.

5
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,610
To put it simply, a computer is a device that stores

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,530
and processes data by performing calculations.

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,695
Before we had actual computer devices,

8
00:00:31,695 --> 00:00:36,240
the term computer was used to refer to someone who actually did the calculation.

9
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,690
You're probably thinking that's crazy talk.

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:41,860
A computer lets me check social media, browse the Internet,

11
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,780
design graphics, how can it possibly just perform calculations?

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,370
Well, friends, in this course,

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,231
we'll be learning how computer calculations are baked into applications,

14
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:53,405
social media, games et cetera,

15
00:00:53,405 --> 00:00:55,150
all the things that you use every day.

16
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,437
But to kick things off,

17
00:00:56,437 --> 00:00:58,590
we'll learn about the journey computers took from

18
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,980
the earliest known forms of computing into the devices that you know and love today.

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,370
In the world of technology,

20
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,030
and if I'm getting really philosophical, in life,

21
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,630
it is important to know where we've been in

22
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,615
order to understand where we are and where we are going.

23
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:17,550
Historical context can help you understand why things work the way they do today.

24
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,475
Have you ever wondered why the alphabet isn't laid out in order on your keyboard?

25
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:25,455
The keyboard layout that most of the world uses today is the qwerty layout,

26
00:01:25,455 --> 00:01:28,725
distinguished by the Q, W, E, R,

27
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:32,215
T, and Y keys in the top row of the keyboard.

28
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:34,965
The most common letters that you type aren't found on the home row,

29
00:01:34,965 --> 00:01:36,460
where your fingers hit the most.

30
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,905
But why?

31
00:01:37,905 --> 00:01:40,223
There are many stories that claim to answer this question.

32
00:01:40,223 --> 00:01:42,660
Some say it was developed a slow down typist so

33
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,985
they wouldn't jam old mechanical typewriters.

34
00:01:45,985 --> 00:01:49,650
Others claim it was meant to resolve problem for telegraph operators.

35
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,993
One thing is for sure,

36
00:01:50,993 --> 00:01:55,250
the keyboard layout that millions of people use today isn't the most effective one.

37
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:00,505
Different keyboard layouts have even been created to try and make typing more efficient.

38
00:02:00,505 --> 00:02:04,335
Now that we're starting to live in a mobile-centric world with our smartphones,

39
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:07,170
the landscape for keyboards may change completely.

40
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,750
My typing fingers are crossed.

41
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,255
In the technology industry,

42
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,420
having a little context can go a long way to

43
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,335
making sense of the concepts you'll encounter.

44
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,500
By the end of this lesson,

45
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,155
you'll be able to identify some of

46
00:02:18,155 --> 00:02:22,110
the most major advances in the early history of computers.

47
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,865
Do you know what an abacus is?

48
00:02:23,865 --> 00:02:26,708
It looks like a wooden toy that a child would play with,

49
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:29,400
but it's actually one of the earliest known computers.

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,355
It was invented in 500 BC to count large numbers.

51
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:37,725
While we have calculators like the old reliable TI-89s or the ones in our computers,

52
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:39,795
abacuses actually is still used today.

53
00:02:39,795 --> 00:02:41,910
Over the centuries, humans built

54
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,370
more advanced counting tools but they still

55
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:47,420
required a human to manually perform the calculations.

56
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,620
The first major step forward was the invention of

57
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,090
the mechanical calculator in the 17th by Blaise Pascal.

58
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,310
This device used a series of gears and levers

59
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,175
to perform calculations for the user automatically.

60
00:02:59,175 --> 00:03:01,920
While it was limited to addition, subtraction,

61
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,173
multiplication and division for pretty small numbers,

62
00:03:05,173 --> 00:03:07,980
it paved the way for more complex machines.

63
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,360
The fundamental operations of

64
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,445
the mechanical calculator were later applied to the textile industry.

65
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:15,720
Before we had streamlined manufacturing,

66
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,627
looms were used to weave yarn into fabric.

67
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:21,090
If you wanted to design patterns on your fabric,

68
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,460
that took an incredible amount of manual work.

69
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:28,825
In the 1800s, a man by the name of Joseph Jacquard invented a programmable loom.

70
00:03:28,825 --> 00:03:31,780
These looms took a sequence of cards with holes in them.

71
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,300
When the loom encountered a hole,

72
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,154
it would hook the thread underneath it.

73
00:03:35,154 --> 00:03:36,831
If it didn't encounter a hole,

74
00:03:36,831 --> 00:03:38,870
the hook wouldn't thread anything.

75
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,690
Eventually this spun up a design pattern on the fabric.

76
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,760
These cards were known as punch cards.

77
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,255
And while Mr. Jacquard reinvented the textile industry,

78
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:50,880
he probably didn't realize that his invention would

79
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,205
shaped the world of computing and the world itself today.

80
00:03:54,205 --> 00:03:57,375
Pretty epic Mr. Jacquard, pretty epic.

81
00:03:57,375 --> 00:04:02,514
Let's fast forward a few decades and meet a man by the name of Charles Babbage.

82
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:05,970
Babbage was a gifted engineer who developed a series of machines that are

83
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,260
now known as the greatest breakthrough on our way to the modern computer.

84
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,900
He built what was called a difference engine.

85
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,180
It was a very sophisticated version of some

86
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,880
of the mechanical calculators we were just talking about.

87
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,950
It could perform fairly complicated mathematical operations but not much else.

88
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,540
Babbage's follow up to

89
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,645
the difference engine was a machine he called the Analytical Engine.

90
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:31,590
He was inspired by Jacquard's use of punch cards to automatically

91
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,860
perform calculations instead of manually entering them by hand.

92
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,910
Babbage used punch cards in his Analytical engine to allow

93
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,570
people to predefine a series of calculations they wanted to perform.

94
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,060
As impressive as this achievement was,

95
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,140
the Analytical engine was still just a very advanced mechanical calculator.

96
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,615
It took the powerful insights of a mathematician named

97
00:04:51,615 --> 00:04:56,325
Ada Lovelace to realize the true potential of the analytical engine.

98
00:04:56,325 --> 00:04:58,635
She was the first person to recognize that the machine

99
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:01,470
could be used for more than pure calculations.

100
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,255
She developed the first algorithm for the engine.

101
00:05:04,255 --> 00:05:07,680
It was the very first example of computer programming.

102
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,255
An algorithm is just a series of steps that solves specific problems.

103
00:05:12,255 --> 00:05:15,210
Because of Lovelace's discovery that algorithms could

104
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,870
be programmed into the Analytical engine,

105
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,425
it became the very first general purpose computing machine in history,

106
00:05:22,425 --> 00:05:25,320
and a great example that women have had some of

107
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,995
the most valuable minds in technology since the 1800s.

108
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,590
We've covered a lot of ground already,

109
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:33,750
learning about how primitive counting devices like the abacus

110
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,388
evolved into huge complex devices like the Analytical engine,

111
00:05:37,388 --> 00:05:39,470
proof that there was life before social media.

112
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,130
In the next video, we'll learn about how

113
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,000
these mechanical machines made the leap into modern computing.
