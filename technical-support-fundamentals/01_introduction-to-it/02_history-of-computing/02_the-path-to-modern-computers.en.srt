00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,480
Welcome back. In this video,

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:17,290
we'll be learning how huge devices like the Analytical Engine grew,

3
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,325
I mean, shrunk into the computing devices that we use today.

4
00:00:21,325 --> 00:00:25,030
The development of computing has been steadily growing since the invention

5
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,395
of the Analytical Engine but didn't make a huge leap forward until World War II.

6
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:32,335
Back then, research into computing was super expensive,

7
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:34,330
electronic components were large and you

8
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:36,820
needed lots of them to compute anything of value.

9
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:39,430
This also meant that computers took up a ton of space and

10
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,445
many efforts were underfunded and unable to make headway.

11
00:00:42,445 --> 00:00:45,010
When the war broke out, governments started pouring money

12
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,550
and resources into computing research.

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:49,720
They wanted to help develop technologies that would give

14
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,920
them advantages over other countries,

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,350
lots of efforts were spun up and advancements were made in fields like cryptography.

16
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,615
Cryptography is the art of writing and solving codes.

17
00:00:59,615 --> 00:01:01,960
During the war, computers were used to process

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,990
secret messages from enemies faster than a human could ever hope to do.

19
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:09,430
Today, the role cryptography plays in secure communication is

20
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,255
a critical part of computer security which we'll learn more about in a later course.

21
00:01:14,255 --> 00:01:18,970
For now, let's look at how computers started to make dramatic impact on society.

22
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,275
First up is Alan Turing,

23
00:01:20,275 --> 00:01:23,665
an English mathematician and now famous computer scientist.

24
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:26,980
He helped develop the top-secret Enigma machine which

25
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,805
helped Allied Forces decode access messages during World War II.

26
00:01:30,805 --> 00:01:33,535
The Enigma machine is just one of the examples of how

27
00:01:33,535 --> 00:01:36,910
governments started to recognize the potential of computation.

28
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,895
After the war, companies like IBM, Hewlett-Packard,

29
00:01:39,895 --> 00:01:43,210
and others were advancing their technologies into the academic,

30
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,010
business, and government realms.

31
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,860
Lots of technological advancements and computing were made in

32
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,250
the 20th century thanks to direct interest from governments,

33
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,070
scientists, and companies left over from World War II.

34
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,912
These organizations invented new methods to store data in

35
00:01:56,912 --> 00:02:00,610
computers which fueled the growth of computational power.

36
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:05,645
Consider this, until the 1950s punch cards were a popular way to store data.

37
00:02:05,645 --> 00:02:10,300
Operators would have decks of ordered punch cards that were used for data processing.

38
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,219
If they dropped the deck by accident and the cards got out of order,

39
00:02:13,219 --> 00:02:15,760
it was almost impossible to get them sorted again.

40
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,768
There were obviously some limitations to punch cards,

41
00:02:18,768 --> 00:02:23,155
but thanks to new technological innovations like magnetic tape and its counterparts,

42
00:02:23,155 --> 00:02:26,625
people began to store more data on more reliable media.

43
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:30,227
A magnetic tape worked by magnetizing data onto a tape.

44
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:32,008
Back in the 1970s and 80s,

45
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:36,180
people used to listen to music on vinyl records or cassette tapes.

46
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,560
These relics are examples of how magnetic tapes

47
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,890
can store information and run that information from a machine.

48
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,256
This left stacks and stacks of punch cards to collect dust while

49
00:02:46,256 --> 00:02:50,380
their new magnetic tape counterparts began to revolutionize the industry.

50
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,734
I wasn't joking when I said early computers took up a lot of space.

51
00:02:53,734 --> 00:02:59,125
They had huge machines to read data and racks of vacuum tubes that help move that data.

52
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:02,140
Vacuum tubes control the electricity voltages and

53
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,190
all sorts of electronic equipment like televisions and radios,

54
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,900
but these specific vacuum tubes were bulky and broke all the time.

55
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,650
Imagine what the work of an I.T.

56
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:14,830
support specialist was like in those early days of computing.

57
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,470
The job description might have included crawling around

58
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,235
inside huge machines filled with dust and creepy crawly things,

59
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:24,710
or replacing vacuum tubes and swapping out those punch cards.

60
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:29,245
In those days, doing some debugging might have taken on a more literal meaning.

61
00:03:29,245 --> 00:03:32,320
Renowned computer scientist Admiral Grace Hopper had

62
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:36,865
a favorite story involving some engineers working on the Harvard Mark II computer.

63
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:40,145
They were trying to figure out the source of the problems in a relay.

64
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:41,800
After doing some investigating,

65
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,275
they discovered the source of their trouble was a moth,

66
00:03:44,275 --> 00:03:46,510
a literal bug in the computer.

67
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,975
The ENIAC was one of the earliest forms of general purpose computers.

68
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:55,450
It was a wall-to-wall convolution of massive electronic components and wires.

69
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:01,630
It had 17,000 vacuum tubes and took up about 1,800 square feet of floor space.

70
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,650
Imagine if you had to work with that scale of equipment today.

71
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,920
I wouldn't want to share an office with 1,800 square feet of machinery.

72
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,385
Eventually, the industry started using transistors to control electricity voltages.

73
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:17,200
This is now a fundamental component of all electronic devices.

74
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,720
Transistors perform almost the same functions as

75
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,020
vacuum tubes but they are more compact and more efficient.

76
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,980
You can easily have billions of transistors in a small computer chip today.

77
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,639
Throughout the decades, more and more advancements were made.

78
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,340
The very first compiler was invented by Admiral Grace Hopper.

79
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,590
Compilers made it possible to translate

80
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,800
human language via a programming language into machine code.

81
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,680
In case you didn't totally catch that,

82
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,220
we'll talk more about compilers later in this course.

83
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,620
The big takeaway is that this advancement was

84
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:51,145
a huge milestone in computing that led to where we are today.

85
00:04:51,145 --> 00:04:56,575
Now, learning programming languages is accessible for almost anyone anywhere.

86
00:04:56,575 --> 00:05:00,130
We no longer have to learn how to write machine code in ones and zeros.

87
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,260
You get to see these languages in action in

88
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,368
future lessons where you'll write some code yourself.

89
00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:07,690
Side note, if the thought of that scares you,

90
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,560
don't worry, we'll help you every step of the way.

91
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,570
But for now, let's get back to the evolution of computers.

92
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:18,215
Eventually, the industry gave way to the first hard disk drives and microprocessors.

93
00:05:18,215 --> 00:05:20,860
Then, programming language started becoming

94
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,190
the predominant way for engineers to develop computer software.

95
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:26,185
Computers were getting smaller and smaller,

96
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:28,780
thanks to advancements in electronic components.

97
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,318
Instead of filling up entire rooms like ENIAC,

98
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:34,060
they were getting small enough to fit on tabletops.

99
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,040
The Xerox Alto was the first computer

100
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,865
that resembled the computers we're familiar with now.

101
00:05:38,865 --> 00:05:40,675
It was also the first computer to implement

102
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:44,570
a graphical user interface that used icons, a mouse, and a window.

103
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,200
Some of you may remember that the sheer size and cost of

104
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,690
historical computers made it almost impossible for an average family to own one.

105
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,250
Instead, they were usually found in military and university research facilities.

106
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,870
When companies like Xerox started building machines at

107
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,140
a relatively affordable price and at a smaller form factor,

108
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,395
the consumer age of computing began.

109
00:06:04,395 --> 00:06:05,980
Then in the 1970s,

110
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:09,665
a young engineer named Steve Wozniak invented the Apple I,

111
00:06:09,665 --> 00:06:12,488
a single-board computer MIT for hobbyists.

112
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:14,170
With his friend Steve Jobs,

113
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,900
they created a company called Apple Computer.

114
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,100
Their follow up to the Apple I,

115
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:22,090
the Apple II, was ready for the average consumer to use.

116
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,415
The Apple II was a phenomenal success,

117
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:26,620
selling for nearly two decades and giving

118
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,785
a new generation of people access to personal computers.

119
00:06:29,785 --> 00:06:32,650
For the first time, computers became affordable for

120
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:37,785
the middle class and helped bring computing technology into both the home and office.

121
00:06:37,785 --> 00:06:41,175
In the 1980s, IBM introduced its personal computer.

122
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:43,930
It was released with a primitive version of an operating system

123
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:47,950
called MS DOS or Microsoft Disk Operating System.

124
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,760
Side note, modern operating systems don't just have text anymore,

125
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,860
they have beautiful icons, words,

126
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,525
and images like what we see on our smartphones.

127
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:58,120
It's incredible how far we've come from

128
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,890
the first operating system to the operating systems we use today.

129
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,340
Back to IBM's PC,

130
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,860
it was widely adopted and made more accessible to consumers,

131
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,045
thanks to a partnership with Microsoft.

132
00:07:10,045 --> 00:07:12,175
Microsoft, founded by Bill Gates,

133
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:14,705
eventually created Microsoft Windows.

134
00:07:14,705 --> 00:07:18,070
For decades it was the preferred operating system in the workplace and

135
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,755
dominated the computing industry because it could be run on any compatible hardware.

136
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:25,730
With more computers in the workplace, the dependence on I.T.

137
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,205
rose and so did the demand for skilled workers who could support that technology.

138
00:07:30,205 --> 00:07:33,730
Not only were personal computers entering the household for the first time,

139
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,535
but a new type of computing was emerging: video games.

140
00:07:36,535 --> 00:07:38,935
During the 1970s and 80s,

141
00:07:38,935 --> 00:07:43,730
coin-operated entertainment machine called arcades became more and more popular.

142
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,940
A company called Atari developed one of

143
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,065
the first coin-operated arcade games in 1972 called Pong.

144
00:07:50,065 --> 00:07:53,440
Pong was such a sensation that people were standing in

145
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,130
lines at bars and rec centers for hours at a time to play.

146
00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:00,760
Entertainment computers like Pong launch the video game era.

147
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,965
Eventually, Atari went on to launch

148
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:08,170
the video computer system which help bring personal video consoles into the home.

149
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,715
Video games have contributed to the evolution of computers in a very real way,

150
00:08:12,715 --> 00:08:15,730
tell that to the next person who dismisses them as a toy.

151
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:20,347
Video game show people that computers didn't always have to be all work and no play,

152
00:08:20,347 --> 00:08:23,525
they were a great source of entertainment too.

153
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:26,245
This was an important milestone for the computing industry,

154
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:27,475
since at that time,

155
00:08:27,475 --> 00:08:32,590
computers were primarily used in the workplace or at research institutions.

156
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,920
With huge players in the market like Apple Macintosh and

157
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,800
Microsoft Windows taking over the operating systems space,

158
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,020
a programmer by the name of Richard Stallman started

159
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,595
developing a free Unix-like operating system.

160
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:50,327
Unix was an operating system developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie,

161
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:53,020
but it wasn't cheap and wasn't available to everyone.

162
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,385
Stallman created an OS that he called GNU.

163
00:08:56,385 --> 00:09:00,160
It was meant to be free to use with similar functionality to Unix.

164
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,320
Unlike Windows or Macintosh,

165
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,315
GNU wasn't owned by a single company,

166
00:09:04,315 --> 00:09:08,490
its code was open source which meant that anyone could modify and share it.

167
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,508
GNU didn't evolve into a full operating system,

168
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:13,990
but it set a foundation for the formation of one

169
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,615
of the largest open source operating system,

170
00:09:16,615 --> 00:09:19,615
Linux, which was created by Linus Torvalds.

171
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,208
We'll get into the technical details of Linux later in this course,

172
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:27,700
but just know that it's a major player in today's operating systems. As an I.T.

173
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:32,015
support specialist, it is very likely that you'll work with an open source software.

174
00:09:32,015 --> 00:09:36,225
You might already be using one like the internet browser Mozilla Firefox.

175
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:40,016
By the early 90s, computers started getting even smaller,

176
00:09:40,016 --> 00:09:42,355
then a real game changer made its way into the scene:

177
00:09:42,355 --> 00:09:45,340
PDAs or personal digital assistants,

178
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,635
which allows computing to go mobile.

179
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:51,685
These mobile devices included portable media players, word processors,

180
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:54,085
email clients, Internet browsers,

181
00:09:54,085 --> 00:09:57,115
and more all in one handy handheld device.

182
00:09:57,115 --> 00:09:58,570
In the late 1990s,

183
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,225
Nokia introduced a PDA with mobile phone functionality.

184
00:10:02,225 --> 00:10:07,255
This ignited an industry of pocketable computers or as we know them today, smartphones.

185
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:11,110
In mere decades, we went from having computers that weigh tons and

186
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,051
took up entire rooms to having powerful computers that fit in our pockets.

187
00:10:15,051 --> 00:10:18,530
It's almost unbelievable, and it's just the beginning.

188
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,930
If you're stepping into the I.T.

189
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,660
industry, it's essential that you understand how

190
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:25,860
to support the growing need of this ever-changing technology.

191
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,330
Computer support 50 years ago consisted of

192
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,225
changing vacuum tubes and stacking punch cards,

193
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:33,460
things that no longer exist in today's I.T.

194
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,245
world. While computers evolve in both complexity and prevalence,

195
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:40,305
so did knowledge required to support and maintain them.

196
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:42,050
In 10 years, I.T.

197
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:46,000
support could require working through virtual reality lenses, you never know.

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,835
Who knows what the future holds?

199
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:52,300
But right now, it is an exciting time to be at the forefront of this industry.

200
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,980
Now that we've run down where computers came

201
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,365
from and how they've evolved over the decades,

202
00:10:56,365 --> 00:11:00,000
let's get a better grasp on how computers actually work.
