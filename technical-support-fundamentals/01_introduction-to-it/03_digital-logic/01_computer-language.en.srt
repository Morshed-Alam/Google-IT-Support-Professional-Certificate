00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:14,770
Remember when I said that a computer
is a device that stores and

2
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:17,140
processes data by performing calculations?

3
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:21,240
Whether you're creating an artificial
intelligence that can beat humans at chess

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,450
or something more simple,
like running a video game,

5
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:27,360
the more computing power you have
access to, the more you can accomplish.

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,400
By the end of this lesson,

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,710
you'll understand what
a computer calculates, and how.

8
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,499
Let's look at this simple math problem.

9
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,736
0 +1 equals what?

10
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:38,158
It only takes a moment to come
up with the answer 1, but

11
00:00:38,158 --> 00:00:41,810
imagine that you needed to do 100
calculations that were this simple.

12
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,732
You could do it, and if you were careful,
you might not make any mistakes.

13
00:00:44,732 --> 00:00:47,970
Well, what if you needed to do
1,000 of these calculations?

14
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,620
How about 1 million?
How about 1 billion?

15
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,820
This is exactly what a computer does.

16
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:58,410
A computer simply compares 1s and 0s, but
millions or billions of times per second.

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,700
Wowza!

18
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,400
The communication that a computer
uses is referred to as binary system,

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,330
also known as base-2 numeral system.

20
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,890
This means that it only talks in 1s and
0s.

21
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:13,155
You may be thinking, okay,
my computer only talks in 1s and 0s.

22
00:01:13,155 --> 00:01:14,570
How do I communicate with it?

23
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,890
Think of it like this.

24
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:19,960
We use the letters of the alphabet to form
words and we give those words meaning.

25
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,660
We use them to create sentences,
paragraphs, and whole stories.

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:28,062
The same thing applies to binary,
except instead of A, B, C, and so on,

27
00:01:28,062 --> 00:01:32,620
we only have 0 and
1 to create words that we give meaning to.

28
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,790
In computing terms,
we group binary into 8 numbers, or bits.

29
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:39,310
Technically, a bit is a binary digit.

30
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,150
Historically, we used 8 bits because
in the early days of computing,

31
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,670
hardware utilized the base-2
numeral system to move bits around.

32
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,780
2 to the 8th numbers offered
us a large enough range

33
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,230
of values to do the computing we needed.

34
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,750
Back then,
any number of bits was used, but

35
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,210
eventually the grouping of 8 bits became
the industry standard that we use today.

36
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,202
You should know that a group of
8 bits is referred to as a byte.

37
00:02:04,202 --> 00:02:09,941
So a byte of zeroes and
ones could look like 10011011.

38
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:15,383
Each byte can store one character,
and we can have 256 possible values,

39
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:18,820
thanks to the base-2 system, 2 to the 8th.

40
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,660
In computer talk, this byte could
mean something like the letter C.

41
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,800
And this is how computer
language was born.

42
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,981
Let's make a quick table to translate
something a computer might see into

43
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:31,220
something we'd be able to recognize.

44
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,720
What does the following translate to?

45
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,920
Did you get hello?

46
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,580
Pretty cool, right?

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,510
By using binary, we can have unlimited
communication with our computer.

48
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,620
Everything you see on your computer
right now, whether it's a video,

49
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,580
an image, text or anything else,
is nothing more than a 1 or a 0.

50
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,870
It is important you
understand how binary works.

51
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,520
It is the basis for everything
else we'll do in this course, so

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,070
make sure you understand
the concept before moving on.
