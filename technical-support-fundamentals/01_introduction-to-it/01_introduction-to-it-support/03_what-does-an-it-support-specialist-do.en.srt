1
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:15,015
So what's the day-to-day work
of someone in IT support like?

2
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,820
Well, it varies a ton, based on whether
you're doing in personal or remote,

3
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,670
support and at a small business or
a large enterprise company.

4
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,980
And there's really no such thing as
day-to-day work, since the puzzles and

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,910
challenges are always new and interesting.

6
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:31,600
But in general, an IT support specialist
makes sure that an organization's

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,930
technological equipment
is running smoothly.

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:37,810
This includes managing, installing,
maintaining, troubleshooting and

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:40,120
configuring office and
computing equipment.

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,050
This program is designed
to prepare you for

11
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,750
an entry level role in
IT help desk support.

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,670
You'll learn how to setup
a user's desktop or

13
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,480
workstation, how to install the computer
applications that people use the most.

14
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,060
You'll learn how to fix a problem or
troubleshoot when something goes wrong and

15
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,940
how to put practices in place to prevent
similar problems from happening again.

16
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,520
Not only will you learn the technical
aspects of troubleshooting a problem,

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,165
you'll also learn how to communicate
with users in order to best assist them.

18
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,586
We'll also show you how to set up
a network from scratch to connect to

19
00:01:11,586 --> 00:01:12,570
the Internet.

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,510
Teach you a thing or two about automation
and scripting and teach you about how to

21
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,940
implement security to make sure your
systems are safe from hackers and

22
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,200
other risk.

23
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,340
For me, my favorite part of IT
support is the problem solving aspect.

24
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:30,420
I love to exercise my creativity to
spin up a solution to a user's issue.

25
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,578
Being an IT journalist also gave me the
flexibility to learn and practice so many

26
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:38,490
different skills and eventually determined
where I want to focus my career.

27
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:42,900
Plus, when things go wrong or you fail at
something in IT, you can take the feedback

28
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:46,340
from those mistakes and be better equipped
to tackle them the next time around.

29
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,640
Using failure as a feedback, is
an important skill both in IT and in life.

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,380
For me, that's why I was so
attracted to the IT field.

31
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,350
I love the process of problem solving and

32
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,310
constantly stretching myself to learn and
grow.

33
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,770
There's also never been more opportunity
to get into the IT industry than now.

34
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,900
Not only is the field of
IT incredibly diverse, but

35
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,810
job prospects are also booming.

36
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,580
It's projected that IT jobs in the US
alone will grow 12% in the next decade.

37
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,440
That's higher than the average for
all other occupations.

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,590
So what does this all mean?

39
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,460
There are thousands of companies
around the world searching for

40
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,550
IT professionals like you.

41
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,700
So the main gist is that IT is totally
awesome and full of opportunity, and

42
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,460
we're so excited that you're here.

43
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,380
So let's dive right in.
