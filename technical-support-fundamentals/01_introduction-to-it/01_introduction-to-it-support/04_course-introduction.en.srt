1
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,990
On July 20th 1969,

2
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,330
one of the most phenomenal events made its way into

3
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,975
the history books when the Apollo 11 completed its historic mission to the moon.

4
00:00:20,975 --> 00:00:24,820
While the most brilliant minds helped to make sure that the Eagle had landed,

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,785
computers also played a significant role.

6
00:00:27,785 --> 00:00:30,100
The guidance system that navigated the spacecraft was

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,755
one of the earliest forms of modern computing.

8
00:00:32,755 --> 00:00:36,875
That same computer, the one that helped America's lunar dreams become a reality,

9
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:40,960
took up the space of an entire room and had one ten thousandth the computing

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,940
power of the thing that almost every one

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,390
of you carry in your pockets today, a smartphone.

12
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,050
Computer hardware and software have had such a dramatic evolution that what was

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:55,000
once only used to power rockets now shapes the entire way our world functions.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,085
Think about your day. Did you grab a snack?

15
00:00:57,085 --> 00:00:59,895
Turn on your TV? Take a drive in your car?

16
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:01,525
Computers were along for the ride.

17
00:01:01,525 --> 00:01:05,355
Literally, computers are everywhere. So here's the rundown.

18
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,600
By the end of this course, you'll understand how computers

19
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,625
work and get a grasp of the building blocks of I.T.

20
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,450
We're going to cover the basics of how computer hardware performs

21
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,355
calculations and we're going to actually build a computer from the ground up.

22
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:21,340
We'll look at how operating systems control and interact with hardware.

23
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,170
We'll take a look at the internet and get

24
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,305
a better understanding of how computers talk to each other.

25
00:01:26,305 --> 00:01:29,560
We'll also spend time learning about how applications and programs

26
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,485
tie all of this together and let humans interact with these systems.

27
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:37,480
Finally, we'll cover important lessons on problem solving with computers and

28
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:42,220
cover the communication skills that are so critical when interacting with others in I.T.

29
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:44,260
Whether you're looking for a job in the I.T.

30
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,785
industry or you just want to learn how your laptop connects to the internet,

31
00:01:47,785 --> 00:01:49,780
understanding how computers work at

32
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,075
every level can help you in your day to day life and in the workplace.

33
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:55,690
But first, let's take a step way,

34
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:58,330
way back, back to where it all began,

35
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,370
even before the Apollo 11 mission touched down,

36
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:06,000
so you can understand how and why we use computers today.
