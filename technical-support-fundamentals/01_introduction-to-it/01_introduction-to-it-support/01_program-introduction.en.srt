1
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,335
There's a big problem in the world right now.

2
00:00:14,335 --> 00:00:15,750
There are hundreds of thousands of

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,100
IT support jobs just waiting for skilled candidates to fill them.

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,270
They're available at this very moment and there are

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,795
companies large and small that really want to hire motivated people.

6
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:27,570
With technology seeping into nearly every aspect of

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,920
business is growing by the second but that's just half the story.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,220
There are lots of people around the world like you,

9
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,675

10
00:00:36,675 --> 00:00:40,540
necessary to get that entry level IT support role.

11
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,231
There might be a few obstacles in the way,

12
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:44,400
maybe you don't have a university degree,

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,505
or the access, or flexibility to take in person training's,

14
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,385
or maybe the cost is just too high.

15
00:00:49,385 --> 00:00:51,430
Whatever the reason, you're looking for

16
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,275
an accessible hands on way to learn the skills that companies are hiring for.

17
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:57,450
Google and Coursera are thrilled to welcome you

00:01:00,805 --> 00:01:03,840
This program is designed to give you the foundational skills and

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,225
confidence required for an entry level IT support role,

21
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:09,255
whether it's doing in person support,

22
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:11,425
or remote support or both.

23
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:15,555
What's really special about this program is that learners get a hands on experience,

24
00:01:15,555 --> 00:01:17,475
through a dynamic mix of labs and

25
00:01:17,475 --> 00:01:20,356
other interactive exercises. Just like what you'd encounter in a help desk role.

26
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:24,780
This curriculum is designed to get you job ready.

27
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,850
But we're taking it one step further,

28
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,980
when you complete this program you'll have

29
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:32,310
your opportunity to share your information with Google,

30
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:34,710
Bing of America and other top employers

31
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,040
looking to hire entry level IT support professionals.

32
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,345
This program has been designed to teach anyone who's

33
00:01:40,345 --> 00:01:43,905
interested in learning the foundational skills and IT support.

34
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:45,810
Doesn't matter if you've been tinkering with IT on your

35
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,130
own or you're completely new to the field,

36
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,460
we'll bring the content developed entirely by

37
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:53,655
Googlers and you bring the passion and motivation to learn.

38
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,121
Here's how we're going to get there,

39
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:59,850
this program is rooted in the belief that a strong foundation and IT support can serve as

40
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,430
a launch pad to a meaningful career in IT And

41
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,880
so we've designed six industry relevant courses.

42
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,395
Technical Support fundamentals, computer networking, operating systems,

43
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:13,530
systems administration and IT infrastructure services,

44
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,250
IT automation and IT Security.

45
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,480
If you dedicate around eight to 10 hours a week to

46
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,730
the courses we anticipate that you'll complete

47
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,980
the certificate in about eight months and

48
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,175
learning this stuff won't be like your typical classroom experience.

49
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:28,509
You can move through the material at your own pace,

50
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:30,210
skip content that you might already

51
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:33,745
know or review the lessons again if you need a refresher.

52
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:36,870
It's choose your own adventure experience,

53
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,680
plus we think that the lint is a strong signal to employers that you have

54
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,020
the grit and persistence it takes to succeed in an ever changing field like IT.

55
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,285
Another really cool part about this program is that it's been created

56
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:52,785
entirely by real world pros who have a strong background in IT support.

57
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:55,815
Their work in IT fields like operations engineering,

58
00:02:55,815 --> 00:03:00,630
security, site reliability engineering and systems administration.

59
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,600
They know this content because they live it every day along

60
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,425
the way you're going to hear from Googlers with unique backgrounds and perspectives,

61
00:03:07,425 --> 00:03:09,561
they'll share how their foundation in

62
00:03:09,561 --> 00:03:13,020
IT support served as a jumping off point for their careers.

63
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,420
They also give you a glimpse into the day to day work

64
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,885
along with tips on how to approach IT support interviews,

65
00:03:18,885 --> 00:03:23,860
they'll even share personal obstacles that they've overcome in inspiring ways.

66
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,610
They're excited to go on this journey with you as you invest

67
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,850
in your future by achieving an end of program certificate.

68
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,285
Last but not least, we gathered

69
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:34,890
