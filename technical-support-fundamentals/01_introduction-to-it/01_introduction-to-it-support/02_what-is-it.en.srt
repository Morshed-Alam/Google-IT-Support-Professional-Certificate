00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:14,990
Welcome to course one, Technical Support Fundamentals.

2
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,640
My name is Kevin Limehouse and I work as

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,480
a support specialist for platforms building DoubleClick at Google.

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,330
Looking back, I can trace from my passion for IT began,

5
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,190
to an actual moment when I was eight years old.

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,553
My parents were about to throw away our old busted computer,

7
00:00:27,553 --> 00:00:30,800
but I managed to convince my mom to let me keep it.

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,845
I remember the moment when I slowly started disassembling it,

9
00:00:33,845 --> 00:00:36,320
kept digging deeper and deeper unscrewing

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,500
every little piece I can get my hands on and I was hooked.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,165
By the time I was 12 or 13 years old,

12
00:00:41,165 --> 00:00:43,625
I became the de facto IT support

13
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:46,820
for my entire family and that's no small feat considering,

14
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,715
I have 11 aunts and uncles and over 35 cousins.

15
00:00:49,715 --> 00:00:53,325
My parents both grew up in very small rural towns in South Carolina.

16
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:57,230
Growing up in the Jim Crow south through the mid 1950s and 1960s,

17
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:58,940
they were taught at an early age that one of

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,790
the better methods to get ahead was through education.

19
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,310
This lesson was instilled in me and my sister and I

20
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:07,490
ended up going to university to study computer science.

21
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,735
I graduate at school right at the end of the 2007, 2009 recession,

22
00:01:11,735 --> 00:01:15,155
but thankfully I secured a job at Google in IT support,

23
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:16,460
where I work with users,

24
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,270
solving their issues and supporting the IT inventory.

25
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,050
And now I've been working in IT for

26
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:23,765
seven years and my current role as a support specialist,

27
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:27,590
I provide technical and billing support to the Google sales teams which

28
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,775
involves everything from troubleshooting to creating forms or editing automation scripts.

29
00:01:32,775 --> 00:01:35,860
Now you know a little bit about me. Let's start from the beginning.

30
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,820
What is information technology?

31
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,470
Information technology has completely

32
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,970
transformed your life in ways that you may not even realize.

33
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:45,440
Thanks to IT, we can communicate massive amounts of

34
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,160
information to people and organizations across the world, in the blink of an eye.

35
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,960
Computers power everything from calculators, to medical equipment,

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,350
to complex satellite systems and the trading desk of Wall Street.

37
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,780
They are powerful and invaluable tools to help people get

38
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,390
their work done and enable us to connect with one another.

39
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,595
So what exactly is information technology?

40
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:07,340
IT is essentially the use of digital technology,

41
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,705
like computers and the internet,

42
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:12,225
to store and process data into useful information.

43
00:02:12,225 --> 00:02:15,410
The IT industry refers to the entire scope of all the jobs

44
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,915
and resources that are related to computing technologies within society,

45
00:02:18,915 --> 00:02:21,875
and there are a lot of different types of jobs in this field,

46
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:25,760
from network engineers who ensure computers can communicate with each other,

47
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,865
to hardware technicians who replace and repair components,

48
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:30,950
to desktop support personnel who make sure

49
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,310
that end users can use their software properly.

50
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,190
But IT isn't just about building computers and using the Internet,

51
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,790
it's really about the people.

52
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,755
That's the heart and soul of IT support work.

53
00:02:40,755 --> 00:02:42,890
What good is technology or information if people

54
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:46,085
can't use technology or make sense of the information?

55
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:49,620
IT helps people solve meaningful problems by using technology,

56
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,585
which is why you'll see its influences in education, medicine,

57
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:57,500
journalism, construction, transportation, entertainment,

58
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,460
or really any industry on the planet.

59
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,465
IT is about changing the world through the ways we collaborate,

60
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:03,770
share and create together.

61
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:07,370
IT has become such a vital tool in modern society that people and

62
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:11,925
organizations who don't have access to IT are at a disadvantage.

63
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,210
IT skills are becoming necessary for day to day living,

64
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:18,145
like finding a job, getting an education and looking up your health information.

65
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:20,450
Maybe you're from a community where there wasn't any internet,

66
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,830
or you couldn't afford

67
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:25,805
a superfast computer and had to use one at your school or library instead.

68
00:03:25,805 --> 00:03:28,160
There are many social and economic reasons why

69
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,690
some people have digital literacy skills and other people do not.

70
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,420
There's growing skills gap is known as the digital divide.

71
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,475
People without digital literacy skills are falling behind.

72
00:03:38,475 --> 00:03:42,005
But people like you are the real solution to bridging that digital divide.

73
00:03:42,005 --> 00:03:43,765
Overcoming the digital divide,

74
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,100
not only involves confronting and understanding

75
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,940
the combination of socio economic factors that shape our experience,

76
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,405
but also helping others confront and understand those experiences.

77
00:03:53,405 --> 00:03:56,180
By getting into IT, you'll help serve those in your communities or

78
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,900
organizations and maybe even inspire a new generation of IT pioneers.

79
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,840
When I think about solving the digital divide,

80
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,020
I can't help but think of all the opportunities and breakthroughs that folks from

81
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,430
diverse backgrounds and perspectives in the industry can bring.

82
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,915
By bringing more people of color, more women,

83
00:04:11,915 --> 00:04:14,880
more ethnically diverse people into the IT fields,

84
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,930
we're bound to see unique new ideas and products that we

85
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,000
haven't even begun to imagine that benefits everybody.
