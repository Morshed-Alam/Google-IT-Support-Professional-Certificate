1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,985
Now that you know how to install, update,

2
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:16,010
and remove software on Windows,

3
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,030
let's do the same for Linux.

4
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,915
Let's navigate back to the git download page.

5
00:00:20,915 --> 00:00:22,595
Under the Linux page,

6
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:26,462
you'll actually see many different ways to install git.

7
00:00:26,462 --> 00:00:31,310
This is because the different Linux distributions use different package installers.

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,230
Since we're using Ubuntu,

9
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,295
we're just going to use this command, apt install git.

10
00:00:37,295 --> 00:00:41,255
Apt is the command we use in Ubuntu's package manager.

11
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:44,685
And the install option will let us install something.

12
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:48,165
Let's go ahead and run this in our terminal.

13
00:00:48,165 --> 00:00:52,025
We're getting an error that says 'permission denied'.

14
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:54,885
Like Windows, when we install something on a machine,

15
00:00:54,885 --> 00:00:58,825
we need to tell the computer that we're authorized to install software.

16
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:02,977
Right now, we can preface this command with another Linux command,

17
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:06,575
sudo, which stands for superuser do.

18
00:01:06,575 --> 00:01:10,925
We'll talk more about the details of a Linux administrator in a later course.

19
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:13,230
So much foreshadowing.

20
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,630
It asks us for a password,

21
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:16,725
so let's add that in.

22
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:18,820
We're getting a lot of output.

23
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,515
We'll talk more about what each of these lines mean in detail soon.

24
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:26,890
It's just asking if we want to continue installing this application and since we do,

25
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,260
I'm going to say y and enter.

26
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:31,136
To update a package,

27
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:36,230
you do the exact same thing as we just did and install a newer software version.

28
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,280
To remove a package,

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,895
we could also use a command pretty similar to the install command,

30
00:01:41,895 --> 00:01:46,780
except this time, we want to remove a package.

31
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,665
This asks us if we want to continue with these changes.

32
00:01:53,665 --> 00:01:55,620
Let's go ahead and type y and enter.

33
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,080
That's it. Now, you know how to install,

34
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,000
update and remove software on Linux and Windows. Nice work.
