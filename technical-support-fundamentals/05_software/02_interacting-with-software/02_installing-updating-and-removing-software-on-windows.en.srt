00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:12,770
Get ready because in this video,

2
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:15,193
we're going to install a program called Git.

3
00:00:15,193 --> 00:00:17,660
Git is a version control system that helps keep

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:20,438
track of changes made to files and directories,

5
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:24,410
like how some word processor today have a revision history feature.

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,790
If you didn't like something you wrote,

7
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,430
you can just go back to a previous version.

8
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,280
We're going to be using Git in later courses.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,803
But for now, we're just going to go ahead and install it.

10
00:00:33,803 --> 00:00:37,670
First, we're going to grab the install program from Git's website.

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,595
I'm going to download the 64-bit executable.

12
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:45,700
Remember from an earlier lesson that we're using a 64-bit CPU architecture.

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,850
So we should install 64-bit applications for better compatibility.

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,470
Next up, you'll see the file extension,.exe.

15
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,310
This is a little different than the text or

16
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:57,945
image file extensions we've seen up until now.

17
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:03,825
EXE is a file extension found in Windows for an executable file.

18
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:06,365
We'll learn more about this in a later lesson, too.

19
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:08,660
For now, just double click on this,

20
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,850
and it'll ask us if we want to install the file.

21
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,215
Voila, that's it.

22
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:39,360
Now you can start using it.

23
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,990
Some program installations might ask you to reboot.

24
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,105
Make sure to do that,

25
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,220
since there might be some system files or

26
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:50,965
processes that also need to restart for your new software to work correct.

27
00:01:50,965 --> 00:01:53,835
To verify that you now have Git installed,

28
00:01:53,835 --> 00:01:57,375
you can navigate to add or remove programs.

29
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:01,590
From here, you can see what applications are installed on the machine,

30
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,205
and there it is, Git version 2.14.1.

31
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:08,768
Let's say you had an older version of Git installed,

32
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,080
and you wanted to update it to the new version.

33
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,350
Luckily, Windows makes it easy for us to do just that.

34
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,280
We can install it just like we did,

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,215
and it'll ask if we want to upgrade to the newest version.

36
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:22,315
To remove software from Windows,

37
00:02:22,315 --> 00:02:25,746
you can just search for the add or remove programs setting.

38
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:28,515
From there, select the application you want to remove,

39
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:31,125
and you'll see a button to uninstall.

40
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:36,330
Let's go ahead and click this and run through an uninstall of the software.

41
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:39,050
It asks us for an administrator password.

42
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,055
We have safety guards in place to prevent

43
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:44,840
unauthorized users from installing or uninstalling software.

44
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,265
We'll learn more about this later, but for now,

45
00:02:47,265 --> 00:02:48,585
since I'm an administrator,

46
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,615
I'm just going to enter my password and uninstall the software.

47
00:02:51,615 --> 00:02:53,595
Once you uninstall software,

48
00:02:53,595 --> 00:02:58,000
restart your computer so we can do the necessary cleanup to completely get rid of it.
