1
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,440
You're doing awesome. By now you've learned what software is,

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,955
how it integrates with our computer, and how we manage it.

3
00:00:18,955 --> 00:00:20,315
It was easy to install,

4
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:23,135
update, and remove software on one machine.

5
00:00:23,135 --> 00:00:26,145
But what if you had to do that for multiple machines?

6
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:28,205
That would take up a lot of time.

7
00:00:28,205 --> 00:00:32,180
If only there was a way we could have it done automatically for us.

8
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:34,910
Spoiler alert, there is.

9
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,215
We use software to help us with this.

10
00:00:37,215 --> 00:00:41,640
There are lots of tools out there that help make managing computers easier.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,415
We use automation for this.

12
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:46,520
Automation makes processes work automatically.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,400
You can even use the tools of automation like programs

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,595
and scripts to help you with troubleshooting issues.

15
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:55,670
So instead of reading hundreds of lines of log files

16
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,495
manually to discover when a particular error occurred on a computer,

17
00:00:59,495 --> 00:01:05,220
you could write a script to read the log for you and print out only the relevant line,

18
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,754
we'll learn a lot more about automation later.

19
00:01:07,754 --> 00:01:10,235
Just know that software has many uses

20
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:14,140
including making processes more efficient and easier.

21
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,562
You made it all the way through software, nice work.

22
00:01:17,562 --> 00:01:21,011
We'll meet again in course five, IT Automation,

23
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:23,613
it's not that scary, really it's not.

24
00:01:23,613 --> 00:01:25,960
I'm excited to show you the power of

25
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,950
automation and teach you some of the actual coding in Ruby.

26
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,370
Next, you'll meet Marty Clark,

27
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,260
she's your instructor for troubleshooting and will talk to you

28
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,268
about how good customer service is critical to IT support.

29
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:41,170
In the meantime, work hard,

30
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,940
soak up a ton of knowledge,

31
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,795
and have some fun along the way.

32
00:01:44,795 --> 00:01:47,000
I'll see you back here later on.
