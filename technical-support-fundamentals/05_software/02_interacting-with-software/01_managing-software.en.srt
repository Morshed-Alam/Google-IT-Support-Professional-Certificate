1
00:00:11,816 --> 00:00:17,230
Programs, software, and applications, are
terms that are synonymous with each other.

2
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,970
For now we'll go ahead and use the term
software to refer to any of these.

3
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:24,350
We've already had a rundown of
the different types of software.

4
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:27,670
There are certain types of software
that perform specific functions,

5
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,310
like drivers, which allow us
to interact with our hardware.

6
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:35,100
There are applications that we use for
our day to day job functions.

7
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,220
And there are utilities that we use like
a calculator, settings, and other tools.

8
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,890
With the seemingly endless options for

9
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:45,420
software, how do we
know which ones to use?

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,780
How do we deal with them in a workplace
setting and in our personal lives?

11
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,090
Software is always changing.

12
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:56,540
Developers are releasing updates, software
companies change, features are added,

13
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,740
and so on.

14
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:01,340
This constant change is
completely out of our control and

15
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,360
it can cause a lot of
headaches in the IT world.

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,850
Let's say the company that
builds your payroll system

17
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,770
pushes out a software update that
causes settings to change or

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,970
even worse completely breaks
the compatibility with your own company.

19
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,500
It can happen.

20
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,490
You should always test new software
before letting your company use it.

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:23,630
Another thing to worry
about is old software.

22
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,220
When you run old software on your machine,
you risk being exposed to cyber security

23
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,350
attacks that take
advantage of software bugs.

24
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,420
A software bug is an error in software
that causes unexpected results.

25
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,780
We'll deep dive into computer
security in a later course.

26
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:44,760
For now, know that software updates
usually contain critical security updates

27
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,970
and new features, and have better
compatibility with your system.

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,410
A good guideline is to update
your software constantly.

29
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:56,090
Another problem that plagues the IT
world when it comes to software

30
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,220
is software management.

31
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:01,145
If you're setting up a computer for
someone, you want to make sure that

32
00:02:01,145 --> 00:02:04,490
they'll have all the necessary tools
they need to hit the ground running.

33
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:09,140
That means you'll need to install all
the software required for the job.

34
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,380
That also means you'll also want to remove
software that isn't required for the job.

35
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,610
We may not realize if a piece of software
we installed is malicious software

36
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,520
which causes harm to your computer.

37
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,550
It's always a good idea to check if
the software comes from a repudible source

38
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,080
before you install it.

39
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,760
A common industry practice is to not allow

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,920
users to install software
without administrator approval.

41
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,720
This prevents users from installing
unwanted software because

42
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,210
they're actually blocked
with an error message

43
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,010
that says they need an administrator
to enter their login credentials.

44
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,820
Before we get too far ahead of ourselves,
let's cover the basics of software

45
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,370
management which include installing,
updating, and removing software.

46
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:55,869
In the videos up next, we're going to walk
through how to do these steps in a Windows

47
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:58,066
environment and a Linux environment.

48
00:02:58,066 --> 00:03:01,062
Ready, set, go.
