00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,430
Hi, my name's Phelan Vendeville and I'm

2
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,515
a Systems Engineer in the Site Reliability Organization at Google.

3
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:21,975
I'm really excited to be your instructor for the next few lessons.

4
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:27,195
Before we jump in, I'll kick things off by telling you a little bit about myself.

5
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:29,855
My passion for technology began in high school,

6
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:33,855
which was located in a geographically isolated part of California.

7
00:00:33,855 --> 00:00:35,990
This isolation meant that technology and

8
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,530
the internet played an important role in bringing the outside world to

9
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,470
students and connecting them with ideas and

10
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,910
opportunities via things like virtual field trips and promote learning.

11
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,490
For example, I remember preparing for the SATs through digital classroom sessions,

12
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:55,380
which would have been impossible to attend in person.

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,970
After high school, I enlisted in the US Navy as

14
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,130
an Information Systems Technician responsible

15
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:03,800
for maintaining computer and network systems.

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,445
I continued to witness the ways technology brings people together.

17
00:01:07,445 --> 00:01:09,740
Whether that meant coordinating ship movements during

18
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:15,005
training exercises or connecting love ones on long deployments via video chat.

19
00:01:15,005 --> 00:01:18,900
Lots of people use technologies in various ways every day,

20
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,295
but relatively few understand how it works.

21
00:01:22,295 --> 00:01:24,350
A career in IT can be challenging,

22
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,200
as I can attest to personally.

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,270
I can still remember the horror I felt after

24
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,240
blowing up the power supply of a master ship's computer,

25
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,260
by using the wrong voltage switch.

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,430
But a career in IT can be incredibly rewarding,

27
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,365
when you can do things like recover

28
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,565
irreplaceable family photos from a failing hard drive.

29
00:01:42,565 --> 00:01:44,690
As an IT Support Specialist,

30
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:49,685
you'll be in a position to not only know how a given piece of technology functions,

31
00:01:49,685 --> 00:01:52,640
but also how to help fix it when it breaks.

32
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,160
This means you'll have a direct impact on the flow of

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,750
information going between people, which is pretty cool.

34
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:01,130
I'm excited to teach you about the third layer of

35
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,860
computer architecture known as software.

36
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,330
Software is how we,

37
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:09,135
as users, directly interact with our computer.

38
00:02:09,135 --> 00:02:13,130
The operating system that we interact with is just software.

39
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:19,305
The music programs, word processors and more that we use every day are also software.

40
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,335
But what exactly is it?

41
00:02:21,335 --> 00:02:25,550
If the hardware is the physical stuff that you can pick up and hold,

42
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,115
software is the intangible instructions that tell the hardware what to do.

43
00:02:30,115 --> 00:02:31,414
In the next lesson,

44
00:02:31,414 --> 00:02:35,225
we're going to deep dive more into what software is,

45
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:39,000
how we install it, and how it works.
