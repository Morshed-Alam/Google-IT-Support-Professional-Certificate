00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,200
When you rate content,

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,610
create a piece of art,

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,250
or engineer something, your work is protected for your use and distribution.

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,195
There's usually some other caveats depending on the laws in your country but in general,

5
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:27,015
copyright is used when creating original work.

6
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:30,555
Software that is written is also protected by copyright.

7
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:34,455
Software developers can choose what they do with their software.

8
00:00:34,455 --> 00:00:38,895
For commercial software, it's common to let someone else use their software,

9
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:40,875
if they pay for a license.

10
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:46,670
For non-commercial software, a popular option is making it open-source.

11
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,920
This means the developers will let other developers share,

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,425
modify, and distribute their software for free.

13
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:56,730
Score. Some amazing software efforts

14
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,690
have been developed in advance because of open source.

15
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,820
One major example is the Linux kernel which is used in

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,450
the Android OS and in enterprise and personal computers.

17
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,530
Hundreds of millions of devices are running Linux at this very second LibreOffice,

18
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,025
GIMP, and Firefox are other examples of open source software.

19
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:20,070
Open source projects are usually contributed by

20
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,055
developers who work on the project for free in their free time.

21
00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:26,550
These massive software development efforts were

22
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,580
essentially built by a community of volunteers.

23
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,640
How great is that? In I.T.

24
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,095
environment, you'll have to pay special attention to the types of software you use.

25
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:40,540
Some may require you to pay multiple licenses to use it,

26
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,925
others may be free and open source.

27
00:01:42,925 --> 00:01:47,370
It's important to check the license agreement of any software before you install it.

28
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,860
We've talked about some of the basics of software,

29
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,350
but now let's shift to the two types of software

30
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:55,035
you'll encounter categorized by function.

31
00:01:55,035 --> 00:01:59,505
Application Software is any software created to fulfill a specific need,

32
00:01:59,505 --> 00:02:00,795
like a text editor,

33
00:02:00,795 --> 00:02:03,330
web browser, or graphics editor.

34
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,110
System software is software used to keep our core system running,

35
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,100
like operating system tools and utilities.

36
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:15,360
There's also a type of system software that we haven't defined yet, called firmware.

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,530
Firmware is software that's permanently stored on a computer component.

38
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,300
Can you think of a firmware that we've talked about already?

39
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,435
If you thought of the BIOS, you're right.

40
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,850
The BIOS helps startup the hardware on

41
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,660
your computer and also helps load up your operating system.

42
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,795
So it's important that it's in a permanent location.

43
00:02:33,795 --> 00:02:36,905
I should also call out software versions.

44
00:02:36,905 --> 00:02:38,640
These are important because they tell us

45
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,540
what features were added to a specific software iteration.

46
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,615
You'll encounter lots of software versions while you work with software.

47
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:49,965
Developers might sometimes use a different standard when distinguishing a version.

48
00:02:49,965 --> 00:02:55,080
But in general, the majority of versions follow a sequential numbering trend.

49
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,930
You might see something like this,

50
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:05,340
1.2.5 or 1.3.4, which of these do you think is the newer version?

51
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,130
It's 1.3.4 because it's a larger number than 1.2.5.

52
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,550
You can read more about software versioning in the supplemental reading.

53
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,070
You'll have to work with all kinds of software.

54
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,980
Fortunately, it basically all works the same way.

55
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,395
Once you learn how one piece of software works,

56
00:03:22,395 --> 00:03:25,260
you'll understand how others might function.

57
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,000
We're going to learn how in the next few videos.
