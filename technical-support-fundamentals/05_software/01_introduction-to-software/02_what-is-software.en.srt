1
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:14,055
Video games, music players,

2
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:15,930
and Internet browsers are all

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:19,380
different types of software that have completely different functions.

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,810
Think of the apps on your phone and your laptop.

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,795
We spend a lot of time interacting with this type of software,

6
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:27,465
but we may not know how it actually works,

7
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:29,435
or gets added to our systems.

8
00:00:29,435 --> 00:00:31,030
In the last few videos,

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,305
we learned about networking and the Internet.

10
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:37,770
There are tons of applications out there that require the Internet to work.

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,165
Think about it, your social media apps,

12
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,575
messaging apps, and others, run off the Internet.

13
00:00:43,575 --> 00:00:48,470
This internet integration isn't just magically added to your application,

14
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,175
it's built in to require it to function.

15
00:00:51,175 --> 00:00:53,730
Before we go too far into the world of software,

16
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,885
I want to call out some common terms related to software that you might hear;

17
00:00:57,885 --> 00:01:03,470
coding, scripting, and programming are all terms that might seem a little blurry.

18
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:07,935
They generally refer to the same thing but they each have small distinctions.

19
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:12,050
Coding is basically translating one language to another,

20
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,850
this can be coding from English to Spanish,

21
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:16,515
English to Morse code,

22
00:01:16,515 --> 00:01:19,380
or even English to a computer language.

23
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,180
When someone builds an application,

24
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:24,015
we refer to it as coding in application.

25
00:01:24,015 --> 00:01:27,076
Scripting is coding in a scripting language,

26
00:01:27,076 --> 00:01:29,775
we'll talk about scripting languages in a later lesson.

27
00:01:29,775 --> 00:01:34,635
But scripts are mainly used to perform a single or limited range task,

28
00:01:34,635 --> 00:01:37,455
there are languages we can use to build these.

29
00:01:37,455 --> 00:01:41,100
Programming is coding in a programming language.

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,730
Programming languages are special languages that software

31
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,660
developers use to write instructions for computers to execute,

32
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,680
larger applications like your web browser, text editors,

33
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,165
and music players are all usually written in programming languages.

34
00:01:57,165 --> 00:02:02,770
When we use the term software it generally refers to something that was programmed,

35
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,675
we'll use these terms pretty interchangeably,

36
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:07,520
so don't sweat the details.

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,580
Now, onwards and upwards,

38
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,395
so what is software made of and who builds it?

39
00:02:13,395 --> 00:02:15,245
That's a great question.

40
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:20,040
Anyone who knows a programming or scripting language can use it to write code,

41
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,570
there's a huge demand for this skill set and

42
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,540
it's becoming easier for someone to learn to code.

43
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,435
Take for example, our very own course 5,

44
00:02:28,435 --> 00:02:32,020
which will cover the basics of using a coding language,

45
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,090
shameless product plug, I know,

46
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,550
especially since I wrote the material.

47
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,425
Anyway, moving on.

48
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,405
If you're going to be working in I.T.

49
00:02:40,405 --> 00:02:43,090
it's important that you understand how software works,

50
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,155
and how it gets installed on your systems.

51
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:49,220
You might encounter software errors or just good old fashioned

52
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,765
failures and you need to understand how to deal with them.

53
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,410
By the end of this module,

54
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,250
you'll be able to understand what software is, how it works,

55
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,545
and how to install it, remove it,

56
00:03:00,545 --> 00:03:06,000
and update it, all within the Linux and Windows operating systems.
