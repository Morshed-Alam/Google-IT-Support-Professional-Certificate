1
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,090
Before we start installing our operating system,

2
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,730
we need to be familiar with the concept of virtual machines or VMs.

3
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,835
A virtual machine is just a copy of a real machine.

4
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:24,180
Why would you want that?

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,400
We've been working with physical machines so far,

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,310
but there are cases in IT support,

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,840
where we need access to a machine that isn't physically in front of us.

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,040
Let's say, I have a Windows machine and I

9
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,770
want to learn another operating system like Linux.

10
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,285
I don't want to buy another computer or have two separate operating systems on my disk.

11
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:44,660
Instead, I can use an application like Virtual Box to

12
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:48,284
install Linux and have it completely isolated from my machine.

13
00:00:48,284 --> 00:00:52,075
Virtual machines use physical resources like memory,

14
00:00:52,075 --> 00:00:53,450
CPU and storage, but they offer

15
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,725
the added benefit of running multiple operating systems at once.

16
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,320
They're also easier to maintain and provision.

17
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,610
Virtual machines have become a staple in many IT departments since

18
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,200
they allow IT support specialists to create new virtual computers on demand.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,840
They can also reclaim the resources they use when they're no longer needed.

20
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,045
If you wanted to use software that's only available on one specific OS,

21
00:01:17,045 --> 00:01:19,568
it's easier to create a new virtual machine,

22
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:22,880
use the software, and then delete the virtual machines once you're done.

23
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,340
Throughout this program, you'll actually be using VMs to perform hands-on exercises.

24
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,575
You'll be working on our Quick Labs platform,

25
00:01:30,575 --> 00:01:34,615
where you'll be presented tasks to complete from within a lab setting.

26
00:01:34,615 --> 00:01:38,810
We list out the specific tasks you'll need to complete and once you complete the tasks,

27
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,383
you'll get the credit for the lab.

28
00:01:40,383 --> 00:01:42,975
Let's go ahead and do a quick walk through.

29
00:01:42,975 --> 00:01:45,360
Okay, let's check out a sample lab.

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,470
I'm going to navigate to one of the labs that you'll be working with later on.

31
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,865
When you log into the lab,

32
00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:56,380
you'll be presented with a doc with

33
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,290
instructions on what you need to do to complete the lab.

34
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:01,030
If you see here at the top,

35
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:04,900
you'll also have a time remaining count down timer.

36
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:08,140
This tells you how much time you have to complete

37
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,985
the lab once you click the Start Lab button.

38
00:02:10,985 --> 00:02:13,822
In this very first quick lab that you'll do,

39
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:15,280
we give you instructions on

40
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,710
how quick lab works and how to log into your Quick Labs instance.

41
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,625
I won't go over how to do that for now,

42
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,410
as you'll get to do that yourself on Quick Labs.

43
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,585
For now, I just want to show you how to connect to the Quick Labs' virtual machine.

44
00:02:28,585 --> 00:02:33,060
I'm going to go ahead and click Start Lab.

45
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:41,060
This will create a temporary count for me on the Google Cloud Platform,

46
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,044
or GCP, or where our virtual machine will be hosted.

47
00:02:45,044 --> 00:02:49,325
Then, I'll be given account information for the Google Cloud platform.

48
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:52,265
If I click Open Cloud Console,

49
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:59,004
I'll be prompted to log in with this account information.

50
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:07,020
I'm just going to copy and paste this information in the login window here.

51
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:24,460
Once I'm in, I'll be prompted to agree to the terms of service.

52
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,390
I've already read the terms of service,

53
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,650
so I'm going to hit Accept.

54
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,320
There might be another terms of service agreement you'll

55
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,085
have to agree to when you're in the GCP instance.

56
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:42,660
I'm going to go ahead and accept this agreement as well.

57
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:47,740
Okay, now we're in the Google cloud platform.

58
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,750
Don't worry about all this information here.

59
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,090
It's not important. What is important is on the left-hand side here.

60
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:57,750
We're going to go to compute engine,

61
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:05,500
then we're going to go to VM instances.

62
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:11,900
Here, you'll see the Windows and Linux instances of this lab.

63
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:15,762
That's right, you're going to be working with both operating systems in Quick Labs.

64
00:04:15,762 --> 00:04:21,708
I'm going to connect to my Linux instance really quick by clicking the SSH button.

65
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:27,785
Again, all this information is explained in the Quick Labs instructions and bam,

66
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:30,990
now, we're connected to a Linux virtual machine.

67
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:32,360
Pretty neat, right?

68
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,905
Once I'm in my virtual machine,

69
00:04:33,905 --> 00:04:36,020
I just do the tasks in the lab.

70
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,980
Once I'm done with my lab, I just go back to Quick Labs and click End.

71
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,260
This will grade my work and automatically

72
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,935
check that I completed what I needed to do in my lab,

73
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:59,680
then remove my temporary GCP account access.

74
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,175
Okay, now that we know what a virtual machine is,

75
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:06,905
you can see how they can be extremely useful.

76
00:05:06,905 --> 00:05:10,520
We'll revisit the ends in the future and see their other many uses.

77
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,260
We're covering a lot of ground fast.

78
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,204
Since we're going to start installing operating systems soon,

79
00:05:15,204 --> 00:05:17,570
feel free to review these lessons to make sure you

80
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,000
fully understand the fundamentals before moving on.
