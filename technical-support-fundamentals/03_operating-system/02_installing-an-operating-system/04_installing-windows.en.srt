1
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:15,950
The first operating system we're going to install is Windows 10 OS.

2
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,440
This is the latest iteration in the Windows family operating system.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,880
If you buy the software in stores,

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,060
it comes in a nifty USB drive.

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,340
I have Windows loaded on a USB drive,

6
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,555
I'm going to go ahead and start the drive, then boot it in a minute.

7
00:00:28,555 --> 00:00:32,400
But first, let's make sure we have our BIOS UEFI boot order,

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,380
set to boot from the USB drive.

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,150
Depending what the manufacturer of your computer uses,

10
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:42,640
you'll either hit F12 or some other key to access the BIOS settings.

11
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:58,705
Looks good. Let's just let it run and we'll see it booting from the USB drive.

12
00:00:58,705 --> 00:01:00,840
Take note that your installation process might be

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,480
slightly different depending on the version of Windows.

14
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,955
Okay, I'm just going to click Next here,

15
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:16,780
just asking for my language preference, my time,

16
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,240
and keyboard, then I'm going to click the Install now button.

17
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:30,000
It's asking for product key,

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,150
am just going to go ahead and skip this, do that later.

19
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,640
And it's just asking me to agree to a software license term,

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,348
so am just going to accept, next.

21
00:01:42,348 --> 00:01:47,725
All right, now it's asking which type of installation I want to do?

22
00:01:47,725 --> 00:01:49,360
I'm just going to click on custom,

23
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,980
because I just want to install windows,

24
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:56,340
I select the drive I want to install it on.

25
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,838
Okay, looks like the computer restarted,

26
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:14,570
now it's just configuring updates.

27
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:19,900
Once it's done updating, it's going to restart one more time.

28
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,290
And now, we're launched into

29
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,525
the screen here that's asking us to enter in the product key.

30
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:35,170
We're just going to go ahead and skip to this for now,

31
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:40,490
we'll do this later, so am going to click, Do this later.

32
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:45,520
And now, it's asking if what kind of settings we want to use?

33
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,330
We're just going to click use express settings for now.

34
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:53,390
So now, we start using our machine as quickly as possible.

35
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:04,590
Okay, it's asking us to create an account for this PC.

36
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,730
The first field is a user name.

37
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,905
A user name is unique identifier for a user account.

38
00:03:10,905 --> 00:03:14,955
I'm just going to go ahead and use my first name as my username.

39
00:03:14,955 --> 00:03:16,830
Next, I'll enter a password.

40
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,588
Once that's done, we'll go ahead and finish our setup.

41
00:03:22,588 --> 00:03:30,580
It's starting to set up everything for us,

42
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:43,950
perfect.

43
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,650
Now, here we are, inside the Windows 10 operating system.

44
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,325
Check it out, this is our user space.

45
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:54,040
We have our desktop environment here where we can

46
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,940
navigate our files, folders, and applications.

47
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,075
The main screen here is called a desktop.

48
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,265
In the bottom right corner here,

49
00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:04,848
we have a task bar.

50
00:04:04,848 --> 00:04:09,395
This gives us quick options and shows us information like network connectivity,

51
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:12,820
the date, system notifications, sound etc.

52
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,905
In the bottom left hand corner here,

53
00:04:14,905 --> 00:04:16,810
we can access the applications,

54
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,456
files, folders, and settings.

55
00:04:19,456 --> 00:04:21,175
You could also shut down,

56
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:24,070
restart, and power off your computer from here.

57
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,725
Let's move onto our system settings.

58
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,761
In the main menu, go ahead and navigate to the settings.

59
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:35,775
From here, you can change any of your system settings like display resolution,

60
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:40,645
user accounts, network, devices, etc.

61
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:44,415
Now, we're going to create a file in our operating system with our GUI.

62
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,417
Let's create a file here on our desktop.

63
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:49,565
All you need to do is right click,

64
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:52,070
and you'll see some options available.

65
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:57,205
Then select new, then text document, bam.

66
00:04:57,205 --> 00:05:00,110
Now we have a text file on our desktop.

67
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:02,017
We just need to give it a name.

68
00:05:02,017 --> 00:05:06,110
How about my super cool file?

69
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:12,000
And that's it. You just created a file on Windows. It wasn't so bad, was it?
