1
00:00:11,685 --> 00:00:15,200
The last operating system we'll
go over is Apple's Mac OS.

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,230
We won't go into too many details
about how to use this OS.

3
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:22,460
Instead, we'll focus on the ins and
outs of Windows and Linux OSs'.

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,120
But if you know one operating system,

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,930
you'll be able to navigate
any operating system.

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,820
Fortunately, all Apple computers
come with Mac OS pre-installed, so

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,580
we'll just go through the important
parts of the operating system.

8
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,100
Okay, here's the desktop environment for
our Mac.

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,730
At the bottom here, you'll see a doc
with shortcuts to your applications.

10
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,990
In the top right, you've got the system
information like the time and

11
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:46,590
date, network connectivity,

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:49,650
battery life, if you have a laptop and
some other quick settings.

13
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,690
In the top left here,
you can see the Apple icon.

14
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,890
This bar will change menu options
depending on what application is open.

15
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,490
But if you click on the Apple icon,
you'll see more options.

16
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:08,400
You can tell your computer to Sleep,
Restart and power off from here.

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,235
The most important thing we want to look
at is at the System Preferences menu item.

18
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,860
This launches our system settings.

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,500
From here,
we can change any of our computer settings

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,280
like setting the orientation of our
mouse scroll, adding and removing users.

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,215
Setting up printers, changing our screen
savers, adding Bluetooth devices and more.

22
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:45,653
I'm going to click on the desktop now.

23
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:52,450
You'll notice our top-left setting changed
from our System Preferences to Finder.

24
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,640
Finder is the file manager for all Macs.

25
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,096
If you open a new Finder window,
you can navigate the files and

26
00:01:59,096 --> 00:02:00,306
folders on your Mac.

27
00:02:07,533 --> 00:02:10,397
If you right click on a file,
or if you're using a Mac laptop

28
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:13,665
you can use a two-finger click on
a file to view more information and

29
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:15,350
perform lots of different tasks.

30
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,770
The Mac, which is a completely different
operating system than Windows or

31
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,710
Linux, operates in a very similar way,
with similar menu options.

32
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,970
Wow, you've really come a long way.

33
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:31,200
You've been introduced to the major
operating systems used today,

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,160
gotten to play around with the system,
and even performed some common tasks.

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,700
Nice work.

36
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,760
It's important in any IT
role to know the ins and

37
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,890
outs of operating systems, because you'll
be interacting with them every single day.

38
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,040
We have a separate course that teaches you
all the essentials you need to navigate

39
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,510
the Windows and Linux OSs'.

40
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,940
But for now, pat yourself on the back.

41
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,410
You just took the first step
towards understanding OSs'.

42
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:59,490
Installing, managing and
navigating operating systems,

43
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,690
are all tasks that you'll have to do
daily as an IT support specialist.

44
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,560
You may even find yourself doing this for

45
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,840
hundreds, if not thousands of
machines in your fleet one day.

46
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,590
Before we send you to the next module,
we have two assessments for you.

47
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,560
Which will test you on creating files,
with both Windows and Linux.

48
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,360
You can always go back and review
the videos again, if you need a refresher.

49
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,540
Otherwise, I'll sign off for now, and
we'll meet again in Course Three,

50
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,370
Operating Systems and You,
Becoming a Power User.

51
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:29,210
In the next module,
you'll meet my friend and

52
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,260
colleague Victor Escobido who's going to
dig into the Internet and networking.
