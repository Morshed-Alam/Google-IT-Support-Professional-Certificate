1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,935
Now that we've seen how Windows is installed,

2
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:16,650
let's go ahead and install the Linux operating system.

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,200
Remember how I said that Linux has many different versions of

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,985
their operating system called distributions?

5
00:00:21,985 --> 00:00:24,300
There are countless articles that highlights the pros

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,915
and cons of the hundreds of distributions out there.

7
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:31,135
We'll go with the most popular consumer distribution, Ubuntu.

8
00:00:31,135 --> 00:00:34,675
I've already loaded Ubuntu on a plain USB drive.

9
00:00:34,675 --> 00:00:37,005
ProTip: Since Ubuntu is open source,

10
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:39,870
you can download the free operating system install image

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,670
directly from their website and install it using whatever media you like.

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,130
I've included a link to it in the next supplemental reading.

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,440
I should also call out that you can't just copy

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,755
the install file to a USB drive and expect it to work.

15
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:57,180
It has to be copied in a way that makes a USB device bootable from our BIOS.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,270
To load the image onto your USB device and make it bootable,

17
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:02,850
you can use a tool like etcher.io.

18
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,505
You can also check out the link to the tool in the reading right after this video.

19
00:01:06,505 --> 00:01:08,880
Okay. Let me go power on. And remember,

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,510
we're gonna make sure that we want to boot from the USB device.

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,430
All right. Now that its loaded,

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,260
you'll see an option if you want to try using

23
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,460
the operating system first or just install the operating system.

24
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,985
We're going to do a fresh install the operating system.

25
00:01:27,985 --> 00:01:30,180
The Ubuntu logo will pop up,

26
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,615
and then we're going to have to go through a couple of

27
00:01:31,615 --> 00:01:34,245
loading screens while the system is installing. All right.

28
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:37,260
We're just going to go ahead and skip through all of these and just pick

29
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:44,744
the defaults for now.

30
00:01:44,744 --> 00:01:50,290
All right.

31
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,820
Now it ask us for our name,

32
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,850
a computer name, or host name, then a username.

33
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,925
The host name is used to identify the computer when it needs to talk to other computers.

34
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:00,960
On our personal computer,

35
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,510
it's common to just use our own names for our computer's name.

36
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,475
But in an IT organization,

37
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:10,810
we want to choose a good host name that follows a certain standardization.

38
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:13,180
We'll go over that in a later lesson, but for now,

39
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,970
let's just use an industry standard for host name,

40
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,370
like user name dash location.

41
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,910
So I'm going to go and enter in my name, Cindy.

42
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,620
Then, for the host name field,

43
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,755
I'm going to type cindy-nyc.

44
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:29,575
Then for the password,

45
00:02:29,575 --> 00:02:32,210
we're just going to enter a password here,

46
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:34,200
then we're going to confirm.

47
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,720
All right. Then, I'm going to hit next.

48
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,180
And then it'll ask us to restart once it's done.

49
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:03,127
Awesome.

50
00:03:03,127 --> 00:03:08,175
Now that's restarted,

51
00:03:08,175 --> 00:03:11,936
let's go ahead and log in.

52
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:16,680
Great.

53
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,025
Now we're in the Ubuntu desktop environment.

54
00:03:19,025 --> 00:03:21,880
Here you can see where applications are laid out.

55
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,945
On the left-hand side here,

56
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:26,380
we have a dock that we can add shortcuts to.

57
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,690
This layout may change since Ubuntu is

58
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:31,150
changing their desktop environment in the near future.

59
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,500
To learn more about this,

60
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,870
you can check out the next supplemental reading.

61
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,360
On the top right-hand bar here,

62
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,325
you'll see quick settings for your computer,

63
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:43,810
like network connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity, sound and volume.

64
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,345
There's also the time, a menu to power off,

65
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:49,293
restart, sleep, and log out of your machine.

66
00:03:49,293 --> 00:03:55,411
Let's click on this menu and select "System Settings."

67
00:03:55,411 --> 00:03:59,740
From here, you can change your system settings, like your screensaver,

68
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:05,960
resolution, hardware settings, and more.

69
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:15,430
Let's go back to our desktop and select this icon here for files.

70
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,160
This opens up a window so we can view our files.

71
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,955
You can see the different files and folders here.

72
00:04:23,955 --> 00:04:26,100
If I click on "Computer",

73
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,200
I'm taken to the main directory of my system.

74
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,297
We're going to get to this in-depth in the later course.

75
00:04:32,297 --> 00:04:36,180
So for now, I'm going to head back to my desktop.

76
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:42,160
Now, let's do the exact same thing we did with our windows machine and create a file.

77
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,800
This time, let's just use commands in the shell.

78
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,775
Because we're in a GUI,

79
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:50,847
we don't have a program called Bash that we run our commands in.

80
00:04:50,847 --> 00:04:54,090
Instead, we open up the search utility here and

81
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:57,780
search for an application called Terminal.

82
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,950
When you open up the Terminal,

83
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,500
you'll see your username, and at symbol,

84
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,605
the host name, colon, tilde,

85
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:08,040
and then slash desktop as your command prompt.

86
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,095
This is used to show who's running the command.

87
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:15,100
This will be more important in another course as you switch users.

88
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:19,150
The last portion of the prompt shows you where you are on the computer.

89
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,955
We'll learn more about this in a later lesson too.

90
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:25,066
But you can see that we're currently in our desktop.

91
00:05:25,066 --> 00:05:27,900
You can verify that we're using the Bash shell with

92
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:33,155
a simple command: echo dollar sign, SHELL.

93
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:37,760
The echo command just prints out text options to the display.

94
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,970
In this case, the argument ''dollar sign SHELL'' is the current shell,

95
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:45,895
slash bin, slash bash or bash.

96
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:50,155
You could even do ''echo Hello'',

97
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:55,230
and it would display Hello, which isn't as useful.

98
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,610
Okay. Let's create a file in our shell.

99
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,460
I'm going to use the touch command.

100
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:07,005
Touch my_super_cool_file.

101
00:06:07,005 --> 00:06:12,880
And here, you can see it made a file on our desktop.

102
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,280
There are many different commands you can use to make a file,

103
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,815
but the touch command in one of the simpler ones.

104
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:20,800
Right now, it might be hard to understand why you have to

105
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,535
memorize Linux shell commands when it's easier to use a Windows GUI.

106
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:26,560
If you'd be working with any Linux machines,

107
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,835
it's essential that you know these commands.

108
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:32,380
Learning commands is also a stepping stone to process automation,

109
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,330
which we'll cover in another course.

110
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,130
Don't worry, by the end of this program,

111
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,370
you should be super comfortable in the shell.

112
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:42,000
Maybe you'll even run commands faster than you can in the GUI.
