1
00:00:11,758 --> 00:00:14,600
In the last lesson you learned
how an operating system boots up.

2
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,920
It's an important concept to understand
since you'll be faced with troubleshooting

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,930
boot up issues in IT support.

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,480
Now we're going to walk through the steps
to select and install an operating system.

5
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,280
We're going to focus on operating
systems in the IT space.

6
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:32,450
First, we'll talk about deciding
which operating system to install in

7
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,110
a business setting.

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:37,850
Second, we'll dive into the overall
process of installing an operating system.

9
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,350
So how do you decide which
operating system to install?

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,940
Well, you need to ask yourself
a couple of questions.

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,170
Has the decision already been made?

12
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,810
The operating systems in
use by an organization

13
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,700
have a lot to do with the applications and
systems that they need to run.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,200
Are you working with an organization or

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,830
service that requires the use
of a specific operating system?

16
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,560
If so, you're done that's easy.

17
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,272
If the decision hasn't been made on
what OS to use, or if you're looking for

18
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,694
an operating system for personal use,
then you need to ask yourself,

19
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:10,880
what software will need
to be run on this device.

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:11,740
In lots of cases,

21
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,880
the software will be designed to
run on a specific operating system.

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,010
It's also possible that
the software is cross platform,

23
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,700
meaning it can run on more
than one operating system.

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,300
Another question to ask is,
what hardware will be used?

25
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,790
Modern operating systems do a pretty
good job of supporting common hardware.

26
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,760
You should keep in mind that
some manufacturers allow their

27
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,100
opperating system to be only
installed on their hardware.

28
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,190
Still a little confused about which
operating system is best for you or

29
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,780
your organization?

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,800
Check out the supplemental reading
right after this video to learn more.

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,770
There's one more thing I should call out.

32
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,140
Remember that we have different CPU
architecture's, 32-bit and 64-bit.

33
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,770
Our operating systems will also be
optimized for this architecture, so

34
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:57,360
make sure that the CPU and
OS are compatible.

35
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,890
If you have a 64-bit CPU,

36
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,980
you should also install the 64-bit version
of the operating system you choose.

37
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:07,700
Okay, now that you've chosen an operating
system that you want to use,

38
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,719
let's work on getting it
installed on our hardware.

39
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,770
Many computers come with
an operating system pre-installed.

40
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,710
If you boot the computer
in this condition,

41
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:19,410
the operating system will continue from
whatever point the vendor left it at.

42
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,370
You'll need to do a couple of things
to finish the installation, like

43
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:28,150
choosing a computer name, or host name, or
configuring the network for the device.

44
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,680
There's more, but
we won't worry about that now.

45
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,416
When we walk through an installation
of an operating system,

46
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:34,688
you'll be able to see this.

47
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:37,589
If you're going to be installing
an operating system from scratch,

48
00:02:37,589 --> 00:02:40,510
you can use different installation media.

49
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,790
Some operating system manufacturers sell
their operating system in disc form or

50
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,440
USB form.

51
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,100
Some let you do reinstalls
directly over the internet.

52
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,650
As an IT support specialist, you'll
install an operating system many times, so

53
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:57,740
using one single disk won't be
time efficient or scalable.

54
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,400
Scalability is an important
concept that we'll cover later.

55
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,740
If you want to scale or
accommodate multiple computers,

56
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,890
the added support is something
you need to keep in mind.

57
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,920
For now, you're only working with
one computer so let's focus on that.

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,690
Let's just use a USB drive to
install your operating system.

59
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,630
Some OS manufacturers have their own
special USB drives with the installation

60
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,530
image like Windows.

61
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,810
For Linux we can load up
an OS onto any USB drives.

62
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,000
You'll see what I mean by that
in the next couple of videos.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,500
See you there.
