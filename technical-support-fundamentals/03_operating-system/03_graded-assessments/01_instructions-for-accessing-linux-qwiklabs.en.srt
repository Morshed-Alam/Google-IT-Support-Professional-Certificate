1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:04,130
In this video, we're going to learn how to access the

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,675
Linux virtual machines from the Coursera platform.

3
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:12,066
As you can see here, there's some information about what you'll be doing in the lab,

4
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:14,560
it's learning objectives, and how much time you

5
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:18,070
have to complete it before you can access the lab itself.

6
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,840
First, you'll need to click the checkbox and provide an electronic signature,

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,736
adhering to Coursera's Honor Code.

8
00:00:25,736 --> 00:00:30,838
Then you will click the Open Tool button.

9
00:00:30,838 --> 00:00:33,155
After you click the button,

10
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:35,840
you'll be navigated to a new browser tab,

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,185
which you see here is the Qwiklabs environment.

12
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:41,120
Each Qwiklab comes with

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,035
detailed step-by-step instructions about what you need to do to complete the lab.

14
00:00:46,035 --> 00:00:49,110
To start the lab, go to the top right-hand of

15
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,365
the screen and click the green button that says, Start Lab.

16
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:54,205
After you click the button,

17
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:57,780
it will take some time to load and set up the lab and the environment.

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,540
While it's loading, this a good time to read

19
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,500
through the instructions about what you'll need to do.

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,755
After the loading bar has filled up completely,

21
00:01:06,755 --> 00:01:11,070
you're now ready to access the Google Cloud Console.

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,385
Google's Cloud Console technology powers the Qwiklab environments.

23
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:19,280
So, in order to access your Linux virtual machine,

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,625
first, we need to sign into the Google Console.

25
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:25,250
To do this, click the orange button on

26
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,445
the left-hand side of the screen that says, Open Google Console.

27
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:33,080
This will open a new web browser tab that you'll need to sign into.

28
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,625
You will not use your own personal Gmail account to access the Google Console.

29
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,530
If you're using a Gmail account right now,

30
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,910
make sure to sign out of it before moving onto the next step.

31
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,680
Let's go back to the previous tab.

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,520
You're going to use the username and password that you see under

33
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,455
the orange Open Google Console button to authenticate.

34
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:57,810
To do this, copy the username by clicking the copy button on

35
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,585
the right-hand side then paste it into Gmail in the other tab.

36
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:06,970
Then we're going to do this for the password too.

37
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:12,055
Copy the password and paste it into Gmail.

38
00:02:12,055 --> 00:02:16,850
After you pasted the password, click Next.

39
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:20,355
Next, you'll see a Terms of Service agreement from Gmail.

40
00:02:20,355 --> 00:02:23,555
To continue on, click Accept.

41
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:26,080
After you click Accept,

42
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,455
Gmail will ask you to provide a recovery phone number and email address.

43
00:02:30,455 --> 00:02:33,055
You don't need to add a recovery phone number

44
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:36,340
or email because each time you access Qwiklabs,

45
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,865
you'll use a new Gmail username and password to sign in.

46
00:02:39,865 --> 00:02:43,925
So, for now, just click Done.

47
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:48,660
Next, you'll see the Google Cloud platform interface.

48
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,480
A pop-up with the Terms of Service agreement will appear.

49
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,250
And you don't need to sign up for updates because this isn't your email address.

50
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,455
Make sure you do click Yes to agree to the Terms of Service, then click Accept.

51
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:05,220
Now, you have access to the Google Cloud platform.

52
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,665
What we'll want to do now is access our Linux virtual machine.

53
00:03:08,665 --> 00:03:12,460
To do this, navigate to the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.

54
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:17,223
Go to Compute Engine and then click on VM Instances.

55
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:20,470
You'll now see a virtual machine instance of

56
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,285
the Linux operating system called Linux-Instance.

57
00:03:25,285 --> 00:03:28,725
There are a couple of ways you can access the Linux virtual machine.

58
00:03:28,725 --> 00:03:30,585
You can click on the project name,

59
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:34,970
click on the drop-down arrow under connect or click SSH.

60
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:37,030
I'm going to click SSH.

61
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,875
This will pop up a new screen.

62
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:43,780
Let the screen load for a bit, and after a while,

63
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,050
you'll see the Linux operating system appear in the pop up screen.

64
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:59,160
How cool is that? This is a working instance of Linux OS.

65
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,230
Now, you're ready to complete the tasks in the lab.

66
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:08,170
You can input Linux commands and continue on with the exercises.

67
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,710
When you're done completing the lab exercises,

68
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:21,280
simply close the window with the Linux operating system.

69
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,535
You should also close the tab with the Google Cloud platform.

70
00:04:24,535 --> 00:04:28,570
Next, go back to the tab in your browser with Qwiklabs.

71
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,780
When you're done, click

72
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,635
the red End Lab button in the top right-hand corner of the screen.

73
00:04:33,635 --> 00:04:37,220
You'll see a warning asking you if you want to end this lab.

74
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,405
After you choose to end the lab,

75
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:41,750
you won't be able to access your previous work.

76
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,390
So, only end the lab when you're sure you're done.

77
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:52,775
You can also provide a star rating or a comment about the lab itself.

78
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:59,065
This will help the Google team improve labs for the future. And that does it.

79
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:03,580
Go back to the Coursera platform and continue with your learning experience.

80
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:07,250
This graded assessment will now be marked as complete.
