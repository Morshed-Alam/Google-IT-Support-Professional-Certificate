00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:15,460
Okay, we've covered the colonel's major responsibilities.

2
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,430
Now, let's discuss the final major aspect of an operating system,

3
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:21,435
how humans interact with it.

4
00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:23,960
This is what we call, the userspace.

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:26,425
When we interact with an operating system,

6
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:29,480
we want to do certain functions like create files and folders,

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,325
open applications, delete items, you get the idea.

8
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,990
There are two ways that we can interact with our OS,

9
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,350
with a shell or a graphical user interface.

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,320
There are also some shells that use graphical user interfaces,

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,285
but we'll work with the command line interface or CLIA shell for the most part.

12
00:00:47,285 --> 00:00:50,170
This just means that we'll use text commands.

13
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,195
A graphical user interface or GUI,

14
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:56,665
is a visual way to interact with a computer.

15
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:58,490
We use our mouse to click and drag,

16
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,395
to open folders etc.

17
00:01:00,395 --> 00:01:02,975
We can see everything we do with it.

18
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:07,205
You probably use a GUI every day without realizing you're using one.

19
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:09,555
To watch this video, you probably used a GUI.

20
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:12,410
Clicking icons and navigating menus to

21
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,615
open your web browser and navigate to the Coursera website.

22
00:01:15,615 --> 00:01:19,430
People usually recognize a device or product based on its GUI.

23
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,400
You might be able to spot the difference between a computer running

24
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,155
Microsoft Windows or Mac OS based on the design of the windows, menus and icons.

25
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:29,995
You've probably seen GUIs in other places too,

26
00:01:29,995 --> 00:01:31,835
like mobile phones and tablets,

27
00:01:31,835 --> 00:01:34,250
ATM machines and airport kiosks.

28
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,830
A shell is basically a program that interprets

29
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,920
text commands and sends them to the OS to execute.

30
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,140
Before we had fancy visual interfaces,

31
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,380
commands like create a file had to be typed out.

32
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,170
While we have GUIs today,

33
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:49,595
the shell is still commonly used to run commands,

34
00:01:49,595 --> 00:01:51,815
especially by power users.

35
00:01:51,815 --> 00:01:55,340
Power users are above average computer users.

36
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,610
In Linux especially, it's essential that you actually know commands, not just a GUI.

37
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,520
This is because most of the Linux machines you interact with in IT support,

38
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,655
will be accessed remotely.

39
00:02:06,655 --> 00:02:09,155
Most of the time, you won't be given a GUI.

40
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:11,330
There are lots of different types of shells.

41
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:12,755
Some have different features,

42
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:15,020
some handle performance differently,

43
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,125
it's the same concept behind different operating systems.

44
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:22,115
For our purposes, we'll just be using the most common shell,

45
00:02:22,115 --> 00:02:26,115
Basch or Bourne Again Shell in Linux.

46
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:28,865
There's also a shelf for Windows called Powershell,

47
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:30,740
but we won't be covering it here.

48
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,020
You'll learn more about Windows power shell and the third course of this program.

49
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,330
Operating systems and you becoming a power user.

50
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,490
Throughout this program, we'll learn how to use

51
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,165
the Windows GUI and Windows shell, Powershell.

52
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:46,730
You might be thinking, but it's easier for me to

53
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:50,125
navigate a GUI,than it is to use commands to do the same thing.

54
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,785
So why would I want to learn both?

55
00:02:51,785 --> 00:02:53,775
I can't stress this enough,

56
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:58,205
it's vital for you to know how to use a shell in an IT support role.

57
00:02:58,205 --> 00:03:00,980
Some tasks can only be completed through commands.

58
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,975
In more advanced IT roles,

59
00:03:02,975 --> 00:03:05,605
you might have to manage thousands of machines.

60
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:08,210
You don't want to have to click a button or drag a window

61
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,435
on every machine when you can just run a command once.

62
00:03:11,435 --> 00:03:14,945
You're actually going to learn how to automate this in a later course.

63
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,075
Using a GUI and shell isn't all you'll be doing,

64
00:03:18,075 --> 00:03:22,075
we'll also interact with our operating system through applications.

65
00:03:22,075 --> 00:03:26,390
There are system applications and libraries that we use on a day-to-day basis,

66
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,935
like the log in application,

67
00:03:27,935 --> 00:03:29,345
system settings and more.

68
00:03:29,345 --> 00:03:33,465
Throughout this course, you learn more about how to use system applications.

69
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:38,000
And we'll even get hands-on with the applications used in your operating system.
