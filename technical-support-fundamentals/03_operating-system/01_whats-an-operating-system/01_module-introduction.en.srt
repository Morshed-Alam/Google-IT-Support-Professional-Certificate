00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,970
Welcome back. You've learned about the basics of computing with

2
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,810
binary and the hardware layer of the computer architecture.

3
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,105
Now, it's time to move onto the next layer, the operating system.

4
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,600
By the end of this lesson, you'll know what an operating system

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,805
is and what makes up an operating system.

6
00:00:27,805 --> 00:00:29,640
You'll also get some hands-on experience with

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,430
the three biggest operating systems used today.

8
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:34,275
Before we get deeper into operating systems,

9
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:36,175
I'd like to introduce myself to you.

10
00:00:36,175 --> 00:00:39,999
My name is Cindy Quach and I'm a site reliability engineer at Google.

11
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:42,660
The team I work on is responsible for the management and

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,335
support of Google's entire internal mobile fleet: Android OS,

13
00:00:46,335 --> 00:00:47,845
iOS, and Chrome OS.

14
00:00:47,845 --> 00:00:49,770
Before focusing on mobile,

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,385
I was a systems administrator on the links team,

16
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:55,350
and before that, I was an operations engineer.

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,570
But like a lot of the Googlers you've met and will meet,

18
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:00,090
I started my career as an I.T.

19
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,490
support specialist. I've been working in I.T.

20
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:03,806
for seven years now.

21
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:07,410
The first time I can remember interacting with computers was in middle school,

22
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,900
where my teacher brought them into our classroom so we could create

23
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:12,529
fun video and multimedia projects.

24
00:01:12,529 --> 00:01:16,030
It was my brother who brought technology into our house.

25
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,320
My parents were immigrants from Vietnam and we didn't have a lot of money growing up,

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,950
so we had to be creative if we wanted to play with a computer at home.

27
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,990
I can remember spending hours with my brother as he assembled

28
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,945
a computer and I would just ask a million questions.

29
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:31,580
Eventually, I wanted to try and build my own computer,

30
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,740
so I gathered up some old parts and saved money to buy new components.

31
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,840
I finally put all the parts together from what I remembered

32
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,669
my brother doing but it just didn't work.

33
00:01:40,669 --> 00:01:43,555
It turns out that I used some incompatible parts.

34
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:46,435
But through a lot of trial and error, troubleshooting,

35
00:01:46,435 --> 00:01:48,688
and long search sessions on the internet,

36
00:01:48,688 --> 00:01:50,440
I finally got it to work.

37
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,550
The feeling I got when I heard my computer boot up for the first time was amazing,

38
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:57,245
and before I knew it, I was hooked on computers.

39
00:01:57,245 --> 00:02:01,240
I really enjoyed the intense concentration and problem solving required in I.T.

40
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,865
but I didn't think a career in tech was even possible back then.

41
00:02:04,865 --> 00:02:07,090
Once I got to college, I had to find a job to help pay

42
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,460
for tuition and that job was an I.T.

43
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,800
support specialist on campus.

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,675
That's when I realized that tech is actually something I could pursue as a career.

45
00:02:15,675 --> 00:02:17,830
Operating systems are an essential part of I.T.

46
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,160
support. Everyone uses a computer to accomplish something,

47
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,215
whether that's browsing the web,

48
00:02:23,215 --> 00:02:25,135
writing a novel, making graphics,

49
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:26,485
playing video games, et cetera.

50
00:02:26,485 --> 00:02:27,940
Whatever the case may be,

51
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,140
they need to interact with their operating system to do. In I.T.

52
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:34,120
support, it's essential to understand how operating systems

53
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,690
work so you can help someone accomplish the task they set out to do,

54
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,480
whether that's figuring out why an application won't start,

55
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,930
why the graphics look funny on their video games, or anything else.

56
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:49,000
Things can get really messy and challenging and that's part of the fun. So let's begin.
