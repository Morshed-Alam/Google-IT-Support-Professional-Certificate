1
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:13,641
Imagine this scenario.

2
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:17,210
You're playing your favorite video game,
and you finally get to the big boss.

3
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,800
You spent countless
hours finding this boss,

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,480
neglecting all other responsibilities
like your job, school, even hygiene.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,390
That's pretty gross, but I get it.

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,160
So you're right about to kill
the big boss when suddenly

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,210
your game console shuts off completely.

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:33,087
You probably freak out for a second.

9
00:00:33,087 --> 00:00:37,710
But then you remember, it's okay, you
saved the game before the boss came along.

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,660
So now you can turn it back on,
and you'll be at the same spot.

11
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,030
But then your console shuts off again,
this happens over and over.

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,390
You, like most people, are devastated.

13
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:51,610
You fly into a fit of rage, but then,
just before you toss your console out,

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:56,310
you make one last ditch effort and
yell, tell me what's wrong with you.

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,220
Suddenly you hear a faint voice
telling you what you want to hear.

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,630
Wouldn't that be amazing?

17
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,880
Sure, that scenario was a bit exaggerated.

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,770
But my point is that our computers
actually can talk to us and

19
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,590
tell us what's wrong.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,580
Maybe they won't whisper answers to us,
but they speak to us in the form of logs.

21
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,040
Logs are files that record
system events on our computer

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,060
just like a system's diary.

23
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:24,085
Our computer will record events like when
it was turned on, when a driver was loaded

24
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:28,300
and even when something isn't working
in the form of error messages.

25
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,830
In all operating systems, logs are kept so

26
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:34,580
we can refer back to them when we need
to find out something that happened.

27
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,290
But logs can be hard to navigate
because our computer will

28
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,170
essentially record everything.

29
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,860
Here's what a log looks like.

30
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,380
As you can see, it can be tough
to make your way through a log.

31
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,030
But, with a little bit of elbow grease,

32
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:50,660
we can figure out what happened on our
computer and piece together a solution.

33
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,880
We'll see an example of how a log
is useful in figuring out an issue

34
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,160
in a later lesson.

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,480
We'll dive into the technical
details of logs in a later course.

36
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,440
For now, just be aware that we can
investigate details about our computer

37
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,220
that aren't obvious to us.

38
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,890
Unfortunately, our computers,
cars and machines

39
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,650
don't have a little voice that tells
us what's wrong when there's a problem.

40
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,173
But by the end of this program, you'll
be able to navigate and read logs, so

41
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:15,345
you won't even need it.
