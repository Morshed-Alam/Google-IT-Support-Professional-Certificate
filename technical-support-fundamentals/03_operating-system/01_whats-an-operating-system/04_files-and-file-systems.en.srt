1
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:14,820
Imagine if you had to store
a single file in a cabinet.

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,220
That's not so bad, right?

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,750
What if, instead of one file,
you had to store 100,000?

4
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,570
Can you see a problem here?

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,550
Well, on our computers,

6
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,340
we can easily store hundreds of
thousands of files, if not more.

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,530
Problem solved?

8
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:31,320
Not quite, we have to be able to
keep track of all these files.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,410
The kernel handles file storage and
file systems on our machines.

10
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:38,750
And in this lesson, we're going to dig
a little deeper on how it does that.

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:42,020
There are three main components
to handling files on an OS,

12
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,700
the file data, metadata, and file system.

13
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,080
Let's start with the file system.

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,020
When we have a brand new hard disk
that we want to store data on,

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,580
we need to erase and configure the disk.

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,340
This way our operating system can read and
write data to it.

17
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,650
This is important, since it's how our
operating system keeps track of files.

18
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,960
So it must know what kind
of file system is used.

19
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,480
There are lot of file systems, and
they're used for different purposes.

20
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,504
Some file systems support the storage
of large amounts of data,

21
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:12,800
others only support small amounts.

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,473
They can operate at different speeds,

23
00:01:14,473 --> 00:01:17,640
and have varying resiliency towards
file corruption, and so on.

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,890
We won't get into which
file system is best.

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,560
That's for you to decide.

26
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,949
But the major OS manufacturers have
their own unique file systems that they

27
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:25,551
recommend.

28
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:30,100
For Windows,
the major file system that's used is NTFS.

29
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:35,394
It was introduced in the previous
version of Windows OS, Windows NT.

30
00:01:35,394 --> 00:01:39,429
And it includes many features,
like encryption, faster access speeds,

31
00:01:39,429 --> 00:01:40,653
security, and more.

32
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:43,982
Microsoft is developing another
file system called ReFS, but

33
00:01:43,982 --> 00:01:46,570
it isn't quite ready for
consumer use just yet.

34
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,850
If you're interested in learning more,

35
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,490
you can read more about it in
the next supplemental reading.

36
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:54,710
For Mac OS,
the default file system is HFS+.

37
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,360
It's journaled,

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,980
which means it does a better job at saving
your disk state in case of a failure.

39
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,870
This is a feature on other types
of file systems, like NTFS.

40
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,350
For Linux, different distributions
will use different file system types.

41
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,120
A standard for file systems for

42
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,140
Linux is ext4, which is compatible
with older ext file systems.

43
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,410
In general, different file system types
don't play nicely with each other.

44
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:25,030
You might not be able to easily move
files across different file systems,

45
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,500
depending on the file system type.

46
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,050
A good guideline to use is
just to use the file system

47
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,560
that your operating system recommends.

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,880
You can read more about
the different types of file systems

49
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,350
in the supplemental reading.

50
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:41,010
Another important part of file management
is the storage of actual file data.

51
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,608
We write data to our hard drive
in the form of data blocks.

52
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:48,830
When we save something to our hard disks,
it doesn't always sit in one piece.

53
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,950
It can be broken down into many pieces and
written to different parts of the disk.

54
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,520
Block storage improves
faster handling of data

55
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,110
because the data isn't stored on one long
piece and it can be accessed quicker.

56
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,620
It's also better for
utilizing storage space.

57
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:07,760
Lastly, we need to keep the metadata that
contains the information about our file.

58
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,400
There's a lot of information about
our file that we want to know,

59
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,880
like who created it, when it was last
modified, who has access to it, and so on.

60
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,960
The file metadata tells us everything
we need to know about our file.

61
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,370
It also tells us what type of file it is.

62
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:25,960
A file extension is the appended
part of a filename that tells us

63
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,338
what type of file it is in
certain operating systems.

64
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:32,626
Take cool_image.jpeg.

65
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:36,500
Jpeg is a file extension
associated with image files.

66
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,140
You'll see different types
of file extensions like this

67
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,010
when you're working with
your operating system.

68
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,956
A working knowledge of file systems and
the differences between them is a great

69
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:48,210
skill to have in your IT
support specialist toolbox.

70
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,643
It can be super useful when you need
to do things like recover data from

71
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:52,610
damaged disks.

72
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:55,760
Or explore ways to boot from two
different kinds of operating systems,

73
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,800
like Windows and Linux,
on the same computer.
