00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,455
So far, we've learned how hard our kernel works by handling files,

2
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:17,495
managing files storage, juggling

3
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:22,125
all the different processes running on our computer, and allocating memory.

4
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,155
Another important task that our kernel handles,

5
00:00:24,155 --> 00:00:26,245
is managing input and output.

6
00:00:26,245 --> 00:00:30,960
We refer to devices that perform input and output, as I/O devices.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,225
These include our monitors,

8
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:35,015
keyboards, mice, hard disk drives,

9
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:39,910
speakers, ruthus headsets, webcams, and network adapters.

10
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:42,905
These I/O devices are all managed by our kernel,

11
00:00:42,905 --> 00:00:46,115
the kernel needs to be able to load up drivers that are used,

12
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:49,880
so that we can recognize and speak to these different types of hardware.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,698
When the kernel is able to start the drivers to communicate with hardware,

14
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:56,192
it also manages the transfer of data in,

15
00:00:56,192 --> 00:00:58,580
and out of the devices.

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,674
I/O doesn't just mean the transfer of data between us and our devices,

17
00:01:02,674 --> 00:01:06,805
the devices also need to be able to talk to each other.

18
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:11,385
Our kernel handles all the intercommunication between devices.

19
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:15,283
It also figures out what the most efficient method of transfer is,

20
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:19,085
and it tries its best to make sure our data doesn't have errors during process.

21
00:01:19,085 --> 00:01:22,610
When you're troubleshooting or solving a problem with a slow machine,

22
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,895
it's usually some sort of hardware resource deficiency.

23
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:27,485
If you don't have enough RAM,

24
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:29,880
you can't load up as many processes.

25
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,275
If you don't have enough CPU,

26
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:33,450
you can't execute programs fast enough.

27
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,448
If you have too much input coming into the device or too much output going somewhere,

28
00:01:38,448 --> 00:01:42,980
you'll also block other data from being sent or received. It's slow!

29
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,290
is one of the most common problems you'll solve in an I.T. support role.

30
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:50,300
Knowing the potential sources of that slowness is

31
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,690
a big help when you're trying to narrow down the cause of the latency.

32
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,130
Troubleshooting is such an important part of any IT support role.

33
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,775
That's why, we'll share some troubleshooting best practices in detail,

34
00:02:01,775 --> 00:02:03,995
in upcoming lessons of this course.

35
00:02:03,995 --> 00:02:06,770
Beyond desktop support, identifying the source of

36
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:09,650
a resource bottleneck in a server or large I.T.

37
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,435
system like a web application,

38
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:16,950
can unlock performance gains and new heights of responsiveness for your users.
