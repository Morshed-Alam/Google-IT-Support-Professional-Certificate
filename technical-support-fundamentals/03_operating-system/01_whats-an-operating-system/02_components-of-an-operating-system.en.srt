1
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:15,095
We introduced the concept of an operating system in earlier lessons.

2
00:00:15,095 --> 00:00:16,585
But what is it exactly?

3
00:00:16,585 --> 00:00:20,000
A lot of us hear the term operating system and think of the interfaces of

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,110
our desktops and phones like the menus, buttons, and backgrounds.

5
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,580
Technically, these are part of the operating system,

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,840
but it's a little more complex than that.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,670
An operating system is the whole package that manages

8
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:34,870
our computers resources and lets us interact with it.

9
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,920
There are two main parts to an operating system,

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,135
the kernel and the user space.

11
00:00:39,135 --> 00:00:42,435
The kernel is the main core of an operating system.

12
00:00:42,435 --> 00:00:46,385
It talks directly to our hardware and manages our systems resources.

13
00:00:46,385 --> 00:00:49,540
As users, we don't interact with the kernel directly.

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:53,935
Instead, we interact with the second part of an operating system the, user space.

15
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:58,345
The user space is basically made up of everything outside the kernel.

16
00:00:58,345 --> 00:01:00,450
The users thinks that we interact with directly

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:03,175
like system programs, user interfaces, etcetera.

18
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:04,660
When we say operating system,

19
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,500
we're talking about both the kernel and the user space.

20
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,660
There are hundreds of operating systems out there,

21
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,244
but we'll focus on the major ones used in IT;

22
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:14,220
Windows, Mac, and Linux.

23
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,425
The Windows OS is developed by Microsoft

24
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:19,350
and used widely in the business and consumer space.

25
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,200
Most PCs you buy come with windows as the default operating system.

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,080
PC means personal computer,

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,170
which technically means a computer that one person uses.

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,700
But in today's world, PC is more commonly referred to as a Windows computer.

29
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,255
So, we'll just refer to a PC as a Windows computer from here.

30
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:37,740
The Mac OS by Apple,

31
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,845
is mainly used in the consumer space.

32
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:41,370
If you buy an Apple computer,

33
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,170
it'll come with Mac OS preloaded.

34
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:47,310
The last operating system we'll dive into is the Linux operating system.

35
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,920
Linux is an open source operating system,

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,580
which means its software is free to share, modify, and distribute.

37
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,590
Linux is used heavily in business infrastructure and in the consumer space.

38
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,655
Linux itself is actually a kernel developed by Linus Torvalds.

39
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:04,195
Because of the way it evolved,

40
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:06,780
we call the Linux kernel the Linux operating system.

41
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,870
Today, Linux has become a huge community effort with

42
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,990
developers all over the world contributing to its success.

43
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,540
Because Linux is open source,

44
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,610
lots of different organizations package their own version of it.

45
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,805
Operating systems like Windows or Macintosh on the other hand,

46
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:23,955
are solely developed by their respective companies.

47
00:02:23,955 --> 00:02:27,750
We call these different Linux OSes distributions.

48
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,690
Some common Linux distributions are Ubuntu,

49
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,415
Debian, and Red Hat.

50
00:02:32,415 --> 00:02:36,780
Another operating system that has started to gain popularity is Chrome OS,

51
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,020
but we won't go into detail on that one.

52
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,240
You can read more about it in the supplemental reading right after this video.

53
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,800
We also won't go over any of

54
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,220
the operating systems used in mobile devices like Android OS,

55
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,345
iOS, and Windows 10 mobile.

56
00:02:49,345 --> 00:02:52,680
But you should be aware that mobile phone operating systems are

57
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,265
quickly overtaking their desktop counterparts in terms of quantity.

58
00:02:56,265 --> 00:03:00,795
Mobile phone usage around the world is more prevalent than desktop computers.

59
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:03,220
You can read more about this in a supplemental reading.

60
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,720
But in this course, we're only going to focus on the Windows and Linux

61
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,615
operating systems since you'll most likely work with them in IT support.

62
00:03:10,615 --> 00:03:12,840
One cool thing to call out is that Chrome OS and

63
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,870
Android OS both run the Linux kernel underneath the hood.

64
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:19,335
So, there's a chance you've already worked with Linux and don't even know it.

65
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:23,705
There are lots of operating systems out there and they all share common characteristics.

66
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:26,940
If you're able to understand the basic building blocks of one OS,

67
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,980
you can apply that to any operating system and understand how it works.

68
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,150
In IT support, it's super common to work with

69
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,740
many different operating systems from desktop OSes to smartphone OSes and more.

70
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,090
Throughout the rest of this module,

71
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,615
we're going to learn what an operating system is.

72
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:43,290
More specifically, we're going to learn about

73
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,955
the two components that make up an operating system,

74
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:48,075
the kernel space and the user space.

75
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:51,000
Before we get there, let's do a rundown of the basics.

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,940
The kernel does file storage in file management.

77
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,000
You can compare it to a physical office file where we store data in paper form.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,100
A computer file is just data that we store and a file can be anything,

79
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,485
a word document, a picture,

80
00:04:03,485 --> 00:04:05,505
a song, literally anything.

81
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:09,660
A file system is how we manage these files just like in an office,

82
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,000
we use a system to store our files.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,280
We don't just put all our files on one cabinet,

84
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,500
that would be seriously messy.

85
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,005
Instead, we organize those files in folders or directories to make them easier to find.

86
00:04:22,005 --> 00:04:24,690
There are lots of different types of file systems,

87
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,030
which we'll cover more in depth in future videos.

88
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:31,550
Another important function of the kernel is process management.

89
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,863
We have many programs that we want to run on our system.

90
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:37,020
To run them, we manage the order they run in,

91
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,120
how many resources they take up,

92
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,815
how long they run, etcetera.

93
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:45,360
Our kernel helps us do this with its process management capabilities.

94
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,285
For example, you've probably used your computer to do several tasks at once.

95
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:53,385
Maybe you write in a text document while listening to music or playing a video.

96
00:04:53,385 --> 00:04:57,895
The process scheduler is part of the kernel that makes this multitasking possible.

97
00:04:57,895 --> 00:05:02,715
It switches the execution of each different process on the CPU faster than you can blink,

98
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:06,270
and it gives you the illusion that things are happening simultaneously.

99
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,120
Next up is memory management.

100
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,590
Our kernel optimizes memory usage and make

101
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,515
sure our applications have enough memory to run.

102
00:05:13,515 --> 00:05:15,475
We won't get into too much detail right now,

103
00:05:15,475 --> 00:05:18,460
so stay tuned for more on this in the next few videos.

104
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:24,070
The last important function that a kernel performs is input/output or I/O management.

105
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,955
This is how our kernel talks to external devices like disks,

106
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:30,300
keyboards, networks, connections, audio devices, and more.

107
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:36,975
I/O management is anything that can give us input or that we can use for output of data.

108
00:05:36,975 --> 00:05:39,005
If you've ever saved a file to disk,

109
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,200
click the mouse button,

110
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,305
or use a microphone when video chatting with a friend,

111
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:46,265
you've got the kernel's ability to manage I/O to thank.

112
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:49,575
And that's the basic rundown of the main functions of the kernel;

113
00:05:49,575 --> 00:05:52,110
file management, process management,

114
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,330
memory management, and I/O management.

115
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,000
Finally, we'll talk about the other component of an operating system, the user space.

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,675
The user space is everything outside the kernel.

117
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:04,540
These are the things that we interact with directly like programs,

118
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,700
such as text editors, music players,

119
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,275
system settings, user interfaces, etcetera.

120
00:06:09,275 --> 00:06:11,230
By the end of this module, you'll hopefully have

121
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,975
a solid understanding of all of these functions of an operating system.

122
00:06:14,975 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's start by taking a deeper dive into the kernel's file management.
