1
00:00:12,243 --> 00:00:16,000
You've gained a lot of great
foundational troubleshooting skills.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,920
But there is some common pitfalls
that you should try to avoid

3
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,890
in order to be at the top of
your troubleshooting game.

4
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:23,630
As an IT support specialist,

5
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:28,530
you'll sometime encounter the same
issue over and over again.

6
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,330
Before the next issue comes in,

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,620
you may find yourself using your
muscle memory to fix the issue.

8
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,760
Pitfall #1, going into autopilot.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,240
Make sure you don't
default to autopilot mode,

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,210
moving through issues out of habit and
without careful thought.

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,020
More often than not there
are small variables that

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,520
change the problem you're seeing entirely.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,680
Ask questions and gather data so
you can fully understanding an issue.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,610
This takes less time than having to
redo some sloppy work you did in

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,730
autopilot mode.

16
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,020
Pitfall #2, not finding the root cause.

17
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,600
It's very easy to get distracted
by small problems that pop up.

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,840
But it's super important to remember
there's probably a very big problem

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,600
causing all these small problems.

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,430
Spend a little extra time
investigating the issue

21
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,970
instead of trying to fix
all the small holes.

22
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,380
If you're trying do a quick fix,
it's tempting to wipe a system and

23
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,480
start from scratch.

24
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,920
This approach is kind of like using
a hammer when a surgical scalpel might be

25
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,150
a more appropriate tool.

26
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,215
Let's say a user isn't able to
access a particular website.

27
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:29,840
Re-imaging the system isn't a great solve.

28
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,630
It doesn't get to the root cause, and it
doesn't help further your own knowledge.

29
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,540
Investigating the problem of it,
testing out possible issues and solutions

30
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,230
incrementally, and identifying the root
cause can end up saving a lot of time and

31
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:46,740
effort in the end, and it feels really
empowering as an IT support specialist.

32
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,830
And with that, you'll be able
to go out in the real world and

33
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,550
use your new skills to methodically
troubleshoot an issue.
