1
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,905
We've got some great questions to understand our problem.

2
00:00:14,905 --> 00:00:19,480
We've isolated our problem to an effective area and looked at our cookie crumbs.

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,700
Now it's time to start fixing the issue.

4
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,010
In the I.T. world, as in life,

5
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:26,670
problems don't always have one right answer.

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,255
When you troubleshoot an issue,

7
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:31,470
you're essentially trying to isolate it to the root cause.

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,325
To help you isolate an issue,

9
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,830
you need to try some remediation steps.

10
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,370
If they don't work, then you can rule those out as the cause.

11
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,890
So what's next?

12
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,865
Here's where the Start-with-the- quickest-step-first method comes into play.

13
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:47,435
We want to get to a root cause effectively.

14
00:00:47,435 --> 00:00:51,250
But sometimes, there are multiple options we can use to isolate something.

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,785
So how do we know which option to try first?

16
00:00:53,785 --> 00:00:58,237
It's pretty simple. Try whatever's fastest first.

17
00:00:58,237 --> 00:01:03,348
I'm having a really weird issue with my software when I start it.

18
00:01:03,348 --> 00:01:05,190
It doesn't do anything and

19
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:14,230
I just installed it.

20
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:18,950
Interesting. It might have gotten corrupted during installation.

21
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,310
Let's reinstall it again.

22
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,430
It still does the same thing.

23
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:33,735
I'm having a really weird issue with my software when I start it.

24
00:01:33,735 --> 00:01:35,865
It doesn't do anything.

25
00:01:35,865 --> 00:01:38,825
And I just installed it.

26
00:01:38,825 --> 00:01:42,760
Do you have to remember if you restarted the computer when you installed it?

27
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:49,095
Oh, it works now.

28
00:01:49,095 --> 00:01:52,010
It's possible that in this scenario,

29
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:54,610
a software reinstall could fix the issue.

30
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,470
It's also possible that a restart was the solution.

31
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,855
Since you can test a restart faster than a reinstall,

32
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:02,690
you should test the restart first.

33
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,320
You want to be able to troubleshoot and resolve issues effectively and efficiently.

34
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,650
So remember to start with the quickest of first.

35
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,000
Your time and your users time are important.
