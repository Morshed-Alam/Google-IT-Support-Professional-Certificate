1
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,570
Another effective troubleshooting method is called Follow the cookie crumbs.

2
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:17,915
What purpose does this serve,

3
00:00:17,915 --> 00:00:20,420
besides making me want to devour a cookie?

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,460
Well, this method requires you to go back when

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,890
the problem first started and work forward from there.

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,532
You would be surprised how much information you can learn from asking,

7
00:00:29,532 --> 00:00:32,797
when did this problem start?

8
00:00:32,797 --> 00:00:35,400
Can you help me with my phone,

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,640
my fun cat app stopped working.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,306
Sure.

11
00:00:40,306 --> 00:00:42,755
Now what do you mean by stopped working?

12
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:44,445
Well, when I tap on the app,

13
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:47,170
it starts to load and then it crashes.

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,180
Well, take a look here.

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:58,155
Okay, let us try reinstalling the app and see if that helps.

16
00:00:58,155 --> 00:01:00,785
It still crashes.

17
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:05,330
I need my fun cat app.

18
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,195
Can you help me with my phone,

19
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:12,200
my fun cat app stopped working?

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,830
Sure, I would be happy to.

21
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:19,610
Can you tell me a little bit more about how it stopped working.

22
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:25,375
Well, when I tap on the app it starts and it just crashes.

23
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,830
That is not good. When did it start?

24
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:30,320
Have you changed anything since that time?

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,800
Well, it worked last night and I was playing around

26
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,155
with it until it started to update and this morning it just didn't work.

27
00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:40,650
It might have something to do with the update.

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,590
Let me take a look into it.

29
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,850
Okay, it looks like there was a bug in the update.

30
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,760
We can roll back to an earlier version and see if that helps.

31
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:56,255
Oh cuddlier peanut, I missed you.

32
00:01:56,255 --> 00:02:00,140
The user can give you information about what they remember but

33
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,250
the systems you work with can also offer insightful information.

34
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,770
In the earlier lessons about operating systems,

35
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,185
we talked about logs.

36
00:02:08,185 --> 00:02:10,805
Remember that logs are like your system's diary,

37
00:02:10,805 --> 00:02:14,530
they keep information about dates and events that happened on the system.

38
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,060
You can dig through logs at the exact time that a failure

39
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,835
happened and you may find some defining events that could have caused your issue.

40
00:02:21,835 --> 00:02:25,380
We will get into logs in more detail in another course.

41
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,000
Error messages are super helpful indicators that can point you in the right direction.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,500
Lots of times, a single error will be lost in a sea of errors.

43
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:38,215
It is best to start from the very first error which may be causing a cascade of errors.

44
00:02:38,215 --> 00:02:39,972
By fixing the root error,

45
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:42,800
you will correct all the other ones in the process.

46
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,945
Some errors don't require extra digging,

47
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:47,565
like a 404 not found error.

48
00:02:47,565 --> 00:02:49,760
You might see on websites that have been moved or

49
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,345
deleted or permission denied error when accessing a protected file.

50
00:02:54,345 --> 00:02:56,105
Let's take a look at this log.

51
00:02:56,105 --> 00:02:58,405
I see an error message here at the bottom,

52
00:02:58,405 --> 00:03:02,040
do you think it makes sense to try and figure out this error message and resolve it?

53
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,110
You might find yourself spending all day trying to fix these little holes.

54
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,540
Let us backtrack up the log a bit instead.

55
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,985
Oh look, we can see where an error first occurred.

56
00:03:11,985 --> 00:03:15,490
Let's try to fix this and now our system is not yelling at us anymore.
