00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,540
Now that we have the ask questions approach nailed down,

2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,509
let's cover another effective troubleshooting method.

3
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:20,440
Isolating the problem.

4
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,220
The goal of this method is to shrink the scope of that potential issue.

5
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,970
Let's start with a simple game.

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,240
I have a number I'm thinking of that's less than 100.

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,775
Can you figure out what it is?

8
00:00:30,775 --> 00:00:33,140
You have five questions you can ask me.

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,364
As you might have guessed,

10
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:37,670
just guessing a number isn't the way to go. Is it five?

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,560
No. Is it seven?

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,945
No. Your odds of figuring it out this way are super low.

13
00:00:43,945 --> 00:00:47,615
Instead, you should be shrinking the scope of where the number could be.

14
00:00:47,615 --> 00:00:50,535
So, you could ask, is it greater than 50?

15
00:00:50,535 --> 00:00:54,260
No. Okay. So, we know the number is 50 or less.

16
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:59,345
We've just isolated our problem and cut down half of the answers we started with.

17
00:00:59,345 --> 00:01:01,020
To narrow the scope further,

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,795
you could ask, is it greater than 25?

19
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:06,255
Yes. Is it greater than 38?

20
00:01:06,255 --> 00:01:09,115
Yes. Is it lower than 45?

21
00:01:09,115 --> 00:01:11,710
Yes. Is the number 42.

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,820
Yes, the number is 42.

23
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,640
Nice work. The power of isolating a problem can

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,645
quickly and effectively help you figure out where the issue lies.

25
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:24,710
The isolate the problem method is meant to shrink the scope of your problem,

26
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,095
so that you know you're looking in the right area.

27
00:01:27,095 --> 00:01:29,702
After you continually isolate the problem,

28
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:32,315
you'll eventually end up at the root cause.

29
00:01:32,315 --> 00:01:36,150
Root cause is the main factor that's causing a range of issues.

30
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,935
Finding root cause is a critical concept in IT support,

31
00:01:39,935 --> 00:01:42,410
because it means that you're able to prevent an issue from

32
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,920
happening again and again to multiple users.

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,195
Sometimes the root cause can be difficult to find, an extremely obscure.

34
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:53,030
Don't give up if it isn't immediately obvious.

35
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,490
Discovering root cause may be tedious,

36
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,170
but it's well worth the effort.

37
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:03,586
Now, let's take a look at a not-so-good and a good example of isolating a problem.

38
00:02:03,586 --> 00:02:08,250
Hi Marty, I can't get my email to work on my laptop.

39
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,305
Hi Gail.

40
00:02:10,305 --> 00:02:15,540
I'd be happy to help with that.

41
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:22,150
Somebody came in the other day with the same problem.

42
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,095
Let's uninstall and reinstall the application.

43
00:02:26,095 --> 00:02:31,885
It still doesn't work.

44
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:37,160
Hey Marty, I can't get my email to work on my laptop.

45
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,055
Oh hey you Gail, sure I'd love to take a look at that.

46
00:02:42,055 --> 00:02:44,980
Have you tried checking your mail on your phone,

47
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,309
or tablet, or something like that?

48
00:02:47,309 --> 00:02:50,955
No, it doesn't look like that's working either.

49
00:02:50,955 --> 00:02:53,740
Let me try.

50
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,240
Wow. You know I can't get any either.

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,580
Let me look into this for a sec.

52
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,365
It appears that the email server is down.

53
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:07,955
The notice says that it's going to be down for about another hour.

54
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,865
How about we wait an hour,

55
00:03:09,865 --> 00:03:12,810
try again, and if you're still having problems we can dig deeper.

56
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,860
Okay. Thanks Marty.

57
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,305
You're welcome Gail.

58
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:20,700
As you can see, it's vital to use the isolating

59
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,850
the problem method to decrease the scope of the issue.

60
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,440
If you can rule out a problem area to look at,

61
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,040
you can troubleshoot more efficiently.
