00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,865
You've already learned about the hardware,

2
00:00:13,865 --> 00:00:18,110
operating systems, and software layers of the computer architecture model.

3
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,560
Now it's time to learn about the most important layer, the user layer.

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,124
Troubleshooting problems and solid communication with users,

5
00:00:25,124 --> 00:00:29,255
maybe one of the most challenging parts of your job as an IT support specialist.

6
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:31,297
But by the end of this module,

7
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:32,990
you'll know the best way to handle them.

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,740
Fixing problems and creating positive interactions with people,

9
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,725
are two fundamental skills that can be applied to

10
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:43,745
almost any situation in the IT world and beyond.

11
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:46,605
Knowing how to analyze an issue,

12
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:48,508
identifying the causes and effects,

13
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:53,150
and use the information to find potential solutions are skills that everyone from I.T.

14
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,730
support specialists, to doctors can use.

15
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:57,655
Hi, I'm Marti Clark,

16
00:00:57,655 --> 00:01:01,130
and I'm a manager with Google's internal I.T. support program.

17
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,985
Even though I grew up around technology and worked at my university's helpdesk,

18
00:01:04,985 --> 00:01:09,905
going into tech wasn't something that was encouraged by my teachers or my family.

19
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:11,195
Now, as a manager,

20
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:15,440
I try to encourage all techs I work with to follow their passion.

21
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,660
It's this passion that help others grow,

22
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,665
and my love for technology that led me here.

23
00:01:20,665 --> 00:01:25,035
Helping people with technology is both a rewarding and challenging endeavor.

24
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:28,040
I encourage my team to take advantage of their work with users,

25
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,360
to spin up ideas,

26
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,355
solutions, and opportunities for improvement.

27
00:01:32,355 --> 00:01:35,730
The technical aspects of problem solving are super useful.

28
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,815
But don't forget the real reason most technology exists,

29
00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:40,970
is to improve people's lives.

30
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,340
Rather it's the routing algorithm that form the backbone of

31
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,470
the Internet or the software tools that let people create amazing art,

32
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:51,380
the ways that people interact with technology are central to IT.

33
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,501
As an I.T. support specialist,

34
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:55,310
you're uniquely positioned to combine

35
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,360
technology and people know how to make those interactions better,

36
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,000
and make a difference in people's day to day lives.
