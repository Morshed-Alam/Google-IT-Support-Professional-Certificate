1
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,025
How would you respond if I asked you,

2
00:00:14,025 --> 00:00:16,815
"Do you know how long it'll take me to get to the bank?"

3
00:00:16,815 --> 00:00:19,060
You'd probably ask, "Where are you?"

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,420
"Where's the bank?"

5
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,270
"Are you walking, driving, biking?"

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,241
But if you just guess the details of my situation to direct me to the bank,

7
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:30,785
your response would be a day late and a dollar short.

8
00:00:30,785 --> 00:00:33,335
It seems like such a natural thing to ask questions

9
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:35,984
and gather information to solve a problem,

10
00:00:35,984 --> 00:00:39,300
but it's usually one of those most overlooked steps in troubleshooting.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,780
Troubleshooting is the ability to diagnose and resolve a problem.

12
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:48,350
One of the most difficult skills to acquire in an IT role isn't technical knowledge,

13
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:54,200
but effective troubleshooting, whether that's helping someone face-to-face or remotely.

14
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,490
It's not specific to the IT world either.

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,270
We use troubleshooting skills every day.

16
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,610
My car is broken.

17
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,270
The light bulb went out. I feel sick.

18
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,495
Imagine if you went to your doctor and said,

19
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:08,810
"I feel sick," and without any other information,

20
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,295
he gives you a prescription for allergy medicine.

21
00:01:11,295 --> 00:01:12,710
Time to find a new doctor.

22
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,700
While this might seem far-fetched,

23
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,380
this can happen pretty often in the IT world.

24
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,270
We're so in the habit of fixing things that sometimes,

25
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,540
we try to fix something without diagnosing it first.

26
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,065
We're going to give you the tools you need to develop good troubleshooting habits.

27
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:29,765
No matter how big or small the problem is,

28
00:01:29,765 --> 00:01:34,160
the first thing to do in troubleshooting is ask questions.

29
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,740
There are a lot of factors that can cause a problem.

30
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,105
You want to make sure you gather all your data before you start to tinker with it.

31
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:42,730
Over the next several videos,

32
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,795
we're going to demonstrate real world,

33
00:01:44,795 --> 00:01:47,645
in-person, and remote troubleshooting scenarios.

34
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:49,340
For the in-person scenarios,

35
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,805
you'll meet Gail and Marty.

36
00:01:50,805 --> 00:01:53,200
And yes, we have another Marty joining us,

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,565
but he spells his name with a Y,

38
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:56,630
and I spell mine with an I.

39
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,170
Confusing, I know.

40
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,510
Please keep in mind these are not professional actors.

41
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,860
We want to give you the opportunity to see how

42
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,320
these different scenarios would play out in real world settings.

43
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,420
Let's look at a quick scenario of a not-so-awesome troubleshooting interaction,

44
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,515
and an awesome one.

45
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:18,060
My computer is broken.

46
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:22,410
Oh, this looks bad.

47
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,535
I think you're going to need a new computer.

48
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:27,840
It's going to be about a 1000 bucks.

49
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,600
My computer is broken.

50
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,305
Oh, okay.

51
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:38,455
Can you tell me a little bit more about how it's broken?

52
00:02:38,455 --> 00:02:40,056
Does it turn on at all?

53
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:42,730
Has there been any damage to it lately that you know of?

54
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,195
Well, when I hit the power button,

55
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:48,270
I hear a "ding," but nothing comes up on screen.

56
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,600
Oh, okay. Can I take a look?

57
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,688
Sure.

58
00:02:51,688 --> 00:02:52,700
Okay.

59
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:58,005
Let me just see what's going on here.

60
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:01,350
You know what?

61
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,540
The brightness was turned down.

62
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,645
These brightness buttons are a little bit fiddly,

63
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:09,520
and it's easy to hit them by accident.

64
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,440
So, there you are.

65
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,060
Great. Thank you.

66
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,940
You're welcome.

67
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,895
If we didn't ask follow up questions,

68
00:03:16,895 --> 00:03:20,965
we wouldn't have realized the issue was something as small as a screen being dim.

69
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:22,655
So, it's important that you're able to gather

70
00:03:22,655 --> 00:03:25,715
enough information to start troubleshooting an issue,

71
00:03:25,715 --> 00:03:27,670
whether it's big or small.

72
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,990
With a little digging, we're able to understand

73
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,200
the situation and effectively troubleshoot the issue.

74
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,590
What's also really important to call out from the scenario is the tech

75
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,720
didn't make the user feel silly for not realizing the screens brightness was down.

76
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,370
Can you think about a time someone made you feel silly or even dumb?

77
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,155
It's a pretty terrible feeling.

78
00:03:46,155 --> 00:03:48,970
So don't be that person that does it to someone else.

79
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,980
Remember, IT support is about working in the service of others.

80
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,940
Always try to create a positive experience for the user.

81
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,325
We'll deep dive into customer service later on.

82
00:03:58,325 --> 00:04:02,180
In the meantime, I'll see you back in the next video on isolating the problem.
