00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,420
In the very beginning of this course,

2
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:17,195
we told you that all that computer does is calculate and process data.

3
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:20,980
We also told you that with that simple function we can post to social media,

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,145
create beautiful graphics, listen to music and more.

5
00:00:24,145 --> 00:00:25,930
Well, in the short time we've spent

6
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:28,870
together you've learned how this entire process works.

7
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,445
That's an amazing accomplishment.

8
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:35,115
You've taken the first step on the path toward preparing for a career in IT support.

9
00:00:35,115 --> 00:00:36,565
Think of everything you've learned.

10
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:39,670
You now know that software developers build the websites,

11
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:43,000
operating systems, tools and programs that we use.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,250
These programs are compiled into machine code that

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,930
our computer takes and processes with the hardware.

14
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:51,130
The data that the computer processes is just binary data

15
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,550
that gets calculated into actual tasks the computer performs.

16
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:58,015
These tasks can include talking to other computers over the Internet,

17
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,760
or even just using a web browser to look at cats.

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,825
We also learned how our data travels across the world to different servers.

19
00:01:04,825 --> 00:01:07,045
But these processes don't work all the time,

20
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:10,405
which is why IT support specialists are needed.

21
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:12,505
As technology gets more complex,

22
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,805
the tools needed to fix that technology also gets more complex.

23
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:18,695
With more and more people adopting a digital lifestyle,

24
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:20,470
more and more fixes are needed.

25
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,270
It's an exciting time to be working in IT.

26
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,585
Soon, we'll have self driving cars,

27
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,105
computers beating world champion Go Players,

28
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:30,860
virtual reality gaming and so much more.

29
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,370
Every day new technology emerges,

30
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,830
and we need more IT support specialists working in the field to keep it running.

31
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,085
But we've only scratched the surface.

32
00:01:40,085 --> 00:01:41,230
You've worked hard to learn

33
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,135
some important skills but there's still a lot more to dive into.

34
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:47,020
You'll learn all the technical details of

35
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,575
the components and processes that we've covered.

36
00:01:49,575 --> 00:01:52,840
You'll learn exactly how information is routed across the internet.

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,180
You'll learn how to set up and support networks large and small.

38
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,200
Not only that, you'll learn how to navigate

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,915
Windows and Linux operating systems like a pro.

40
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:04,630
Before too long, you'll be able to manage a fleet of

41
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,160
computers and administer them using industry best practices.

42
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,290
You'll even learn how to automate some of these processes.

43
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,080
Finally, you'll learn how to keep everything you've built safe and

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,040
secure using industry standards for computer security.

45
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,740
So, welcome to the world of IT support.

46
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,380
There's so much more exciting stuff coming up.

47
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,000
So, let's get to it.
