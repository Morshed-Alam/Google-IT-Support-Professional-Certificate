00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:15,445
Now that we've talked a little
bit about documenting processes,

2
00:00:15,445 --> 00:00:19,712
let's talk about how you'll write
documentation in ticketing or bug system.

3
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,219
You don't have to leave a full
example of process documentation for

4
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:25,130
every ticket you handle.

5
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:28,670
If you encounter the same issue,
just write the documentation once,

6
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,270
then refer back to it.

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:34,110
One of the more important aspects of
writing documentation in a ticket or

8
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,620
bug is that you leave an audit trail
to see what worked and what didn't.

9
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:43,248
Let's take a look at some examples
of awesome documentation and

10
00:00:43,248 --> 00:00:46,954
not-so-awesome documentation
in ticketing and bug systems.

11
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:54,509
This isn't helpful at all,
since we don't know what the issue was, or

12
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:57,830
what the IT support
specialist did to fix it.

13
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,141
If someone stumbled upon this
ticket with the same issue,

14
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:02,772
it would be pretty useless.

15
00:01:09,128 --> 00:01:13,322
This is an example of
a great ticket documentation.

16
00:01:13,322 --> 00:01:18,273
A tech described what the issue is,
what caused the issue,

17
00:01:18,273 --> 00:01:22,242
and the specific steps
they took to resolve it.
