1
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:15,761
Have you ever worked hard on
something that had a lot of steps and

2
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:19,650
took a long time, only to have to
do it again three months later?

3
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,900
And completely forgotten
everything you did?

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,390
Well, that happens all
the time in the IT world.

5
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,610
That's why it's important to
document the work you do.

6
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,260
Documentation might seem like a time suck,
but it's a total time saver.

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,330
There are two main ways we document
information in the IT industry.

8
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:40,500
The first is through ticketing or
bug system.

9
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,390
Tickets are a common way
of documenting an issue.

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:47,910
Bugs are issues with the system that
weren't caused by external source.

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,460
Imagine, if every time something
broke you receive an e-mail.

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,411
That'd be hard to keep track of and
not scalable at all.

13
00:00:54,411 --> 00:00:59,320
The IT industry utilizes systems
just to keep track of this for you.

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,048
Some examples are Bugzilla,
JIRA, and Redmine.

15
00:01:03,048 --> 00:01:07,220
These are all-in-one solutions
that help you track user issues,

16
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,040
communicate with your users,
and provide updates.

17
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,710
A great way to use the system for

18
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:17,480
documentation is to update the ticket
with what the issue is, the steps and

19
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,650
procedures you're trying to resolve,
and the solution you arrived at.

20
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,050
This is important for two reasons.

21
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,640
The first,
is that it keeps the user in the loop.

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,220
The second, is that it helps you audit
your steps in case you need to go back and

23
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,500
see what you did.

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,756
You can also write down procedures and
policies to create a documentation trail.

25
00:01:36,756 --> 00:01:39,199
You have a lot of options of
where you want to write, and

26
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,220
store your documentation.

27
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,560
You can keep your policies and
procedures in a document

28
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,260
webpage through online file storage,
or lots of other mediums.

29
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:52,640
Just make sure it's accessible to
everyone else in your company.

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,490
If you have a monthly reoccurring task,
like updating old software on machines,

31
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:02,160
make sure to write down all the steps and
then refer back to them when it's needed.

32
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,500
Documentation isn't a set it and
forget it situation.

33
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:09,050
Systems and
processes are constantly changing, and so

34
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,610
should your documentation.

35
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,460
It's important to update documentation.

36
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,550
So that you aren't reading
something that's old.

37
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,920
One last thing I want to call
out about writing documentation

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,460
is that you don't need to get
creative with your writing.

39
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,310
You aren't writing a short story.

40
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,220
You're writing a technical document.

41
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,312
You want to be as concise as possible.

42
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:30,338
So that when someone reads your document,

43
00:02:30,338 --> 00:02:32,600
they can easily figure
out what they need to do.
