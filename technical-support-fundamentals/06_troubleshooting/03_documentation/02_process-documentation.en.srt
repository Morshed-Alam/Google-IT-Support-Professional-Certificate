00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,355
Let us take a look at examples of good and not-so-good documentation.

2
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:20,660
Here is the deal. You encounter a strange issue when helping a user out.

3
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:27,190
This issue happens so often that you and your colleagues have encountered it.

4
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:32,730
No documentation is the worse documentation.

5
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:34,815
Imagine if it took you hours to figure out

6
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:38,125
an issue to a problem and you didn't write it down.

7
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:42,300
Your colleague encounters the same issue and takes hours to figure it out.

8
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,780
Then, he also does not write it down.

9
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:47,090
This can go on and on.

10
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,755
It only takes a little bit of effort to create documentation,

11
00:00:50,755 --> 00:00:53,355
and it can save you so much of your time,

12
00:00:53,355 --> 00:00:58,007
your company's time, and your users time.

13
00:00:58,007 --> 00:01:00,749
Okay.

14
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:06,960
This is not the best example of documentation.

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,685
The problem the IT support specialist stated is not specific,

16
00:01:10,685 --> 00:01:13,990
and it leaves you with more questions than answers.

17
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,715
And while it tells you what will fix an issue,

18
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:18,395
it does not tell you how.

19
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:21,720
Documentation should be straight and clear-cut.

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,562
Your reader should not have any questions when following the instructions you listed.

21
00:01:27,562 --> 00:01:36,076
Now, this is a good example of documentation.

22
00:01:36,076 --> 00:01:40,765
It starts off with a very specific and clear problem.

23
00:01:40,765 --> 00:01:44,065
It gives you background information on what the issue is.

24
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:48,375
It even gives you the exact instructions on how to fix the issue,

25
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:51,715
including which settings to navigate to and where.

26
00:01:51,715 --> 00:01:56,120
Remember, always write documentation that makes it easy for your reader to follow.
