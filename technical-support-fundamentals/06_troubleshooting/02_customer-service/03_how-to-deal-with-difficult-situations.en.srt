1
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,930
If you've ever worked in customer service,

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,210
then you've dealt with difficult situations.

3
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,835
The way you handle them in the food industry,

4
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:20,740
and tech world are pretty similar.

5
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:22,225
But before we dive into that,

6
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:24,640
we're going to take a step back and talk about the science

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,520
behind what's happening in these situations.

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,160
Let's say someone's yelling at you,

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,680
whether it's about overcooked steak or broken computer,

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,050
your reaction to either will probably be similar.

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,630
Your palms might be sweating,

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,910
your hands might shake,

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:40,410
or your mouth goes dry,

14
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,220
tunnel vision might kick in.

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:45,475
These are all normal physiological reactions

16
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:48,635
that happen in response to a perceived threat.

17
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:51,087
This is part of our biological make up

18
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:54,075
dating back to the time when people hunted for their food.

19
00:00:54,075 --> 00:00:56,065
When you're being chased by a cougar,

20
00:00:56,065 --> 00:01:00,035
you needed your senses to be at high alert in order to keep yourself alive.

21
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:04,090
Even though someone yelling at you isn't the same as the cougar attacking you,

22
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,965
it can feel similar in the moment.

23
00:01:05,965 --> 00:01:08,410
Your brain is releasing a mix of chemicals and

24
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:12,175
hormones to heighten your senses and keep you alert.

25
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:14,680
Unfortunately, a side effect is that you may have trouble

26
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,565
focusing on a specific task. Not ideal.

27
00:01:17,565 --> 00:01:20,410
It's in times like these that you might go on autopilot,

28
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:24,845
where your body has a physical reaction and it's hard to focus.

29
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:27,610
It's super important to recognize these moments and put

30
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,475
a plan in place to reboot yourself out of the situation.

31
00:01:31,475 --> 00:01:35,520
Sometimes I feel this way when I'm teaching a class and someone is ignoring me.

32
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,330
They just don't pay attention.

33
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,785
I used to call them out on it.

34
00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:40,195
The fight response.

35
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:41,700
But this never ended well.

36
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,335
Sometimes they had a good reason for being on their phone,

37
00:01:44,335 --> 00:01:47,220
and calling them out never made them listen more.

38
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,825
Now when I feel myself in that situation,

39
00:01:49,825 --> 00:01:52,075
I notice that my pulse increases.

40
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:53,735
When I realize that's happening,

41
00:01:53,735 --> 00:01:58,600
I make sure to look around and focus on people who are more engaged in the lesson,

42
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,550
and make eye contact with them.

43
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,600
Soon, I feel my pulse slow down.

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,475
Some of your experiences in IT support might trigger similar reactions.

45
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:12,220
Once you've identified this reboot action, write it down.

46
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:15,615
Remember, your brain isn't always working well in the heat of the moment.

47
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:18,560
So it helps to have something to remind you what to do.

48
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,360
It could be anything from squeezing a stress ball,

49
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,525
to looking away, to taking a deep breath.

50
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:27,785
The first couple of times it may not work,

51
00:02:27,785 --> 00:02:29,050
so give it time.

52
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,090
When you have a difficult situation,

53
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,755
take a moment to think about what went wrong.

54
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:35,050
How are you feeling?

55
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,685
What was your reaction?

56
00:02:36,685 --> 00:02:38,240
Why did you raise your voice?

57
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,495
After a while, it becomes second nature to catch yourself and deescalate situation.

58
00:02:43,495 --> 00:02:46,005
To really hold yourself accountable,

59
00:02:46,005 --> 00:02:48,250
tell a coworker what you're trying to do,

60
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,485
give them a recap of the interaction,

61
00:02:50,485 --> 00:02:53,065
and ask them for their feedback on the interaction.

62
00:02:53,065 --> 00:02:55,280
You might get some great tips.

63
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,065
But here's the bad news.

64
00:02:57,065 --> 00:03:00,090
Things aren't over when you get yourself back on track.

65
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,165
That's when the hard work starts.

66
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:03,815
Every situation is different,

67
00:03:03,815 --> 00:03:07,990
and you'll learn the best strategies from experience and peer feedback.

68
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,300
To get you started,

69
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,830
I'll run through some tried and true techniques.

70
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,400
Keep in mind that it's fine if you don't get these right the first time.

71
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,365
It takes practice, reflection,

72
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:20,530
and feedback to really nail it. So don't give up.

73
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,620
The hardest and arguably the best technique,

74
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,930
is to identify where the interaction went

75
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,440
wrong in the moment and redirect the conversation.

76
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,820
This is really tough,

77
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,470
because it means remaining calm enough to objectively look at the interaction,

78
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,495
and understand what could have caused it to escalate.

79
00:03:38,495 --> 00:03:43,270
At first, try this once the interaction is over.

80
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,410
You started your chat with the user and it's really

81
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,140
pleasant and problem solving is happening.

82
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,435
Then suddenly the tone turns dark.

83
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:32,085
What caused it? Where was the misstep?

84
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:34,970
Looking back, you might notice that the user didn't understand

85
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,440
the question about what happens when he tries to sync his phone.

86
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,505
And the tech just kept repeating it.

87
00:04:40,505 --> 00:04:43,510
The user gets annoyed and then starts typing in all caps.

88
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:46,310
A clear sign they're irritated.

89
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,865
In this case, the cause seems obvious.

90
00:04:48,865 --> 00:04:51,135
If the user didn't understand the question,

91
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:55,895
then they probably got frustrated when the same question was asked over and over.

92
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,970
If the IT support specialist had noticed this,

93
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,950
they could have reframed the question and

94
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:18,709
broken it down further.

95
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:36,955
Another cause of frustration in user support interactions,

96
00:05:36,955 --> 00:05:39,140
is when people talk over each other.

97
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,145
This usually happens over the phone,

98
00:05:41,145 --> 00:05:43,000
since there is sometimes a delay.

99
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,155
But it can happen in person too.

100
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:47,680
Typically, it leads to people talking louder and

101
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,815
sometimes ends up feeling like you're yelling at each other.

102
00:05:50,815 --> 00:05:54,380
You've probably been in a situation like this with your friends or family.

103
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,810
Everyone wants to talk,

104
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,750
and the person with the loudest voice wins.

105
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,250
How can I help you today?

106
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,590
My laptop isn't working, I need a new one.

107
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,410
I have meetings I need to go to.

108
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,465
I can certainly look into this and see what we can do to fix it.

109
00:06:10,465 --> 00:06:13,600
But I want to set context that our policy is to

110
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,230
only replace laptops if all other options have been exhausted.

111
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,950
I don't need you to go snooping around my computer.

112
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,280
Just give me a new one.

113
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,500
Gail, I'd love to do that for you, but.

114
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,780
That's ridiculous. I'm a director.

115
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,120
I should get a new one. I don't have time for this.

116
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,145
I completely understand the urgency of the situation.

117
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:32,320
Why don't you let me take a look at.

118
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,550
That's why I came.

119
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,440
You need to fix it.

120
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,855
It's important to try and identify why this is happening,

121
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:41,515
so you can course correct.

122
00:06:41,515 --> 00:06:46,075
In this case, you can simply stop talking to calm things down,

123
00:06:46,075 --> 00:06:48,560
and then pause for about five or ten seconds

124
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,375
to make sure they're done talking and start again.

125
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:55,400
This might take a few tries before the user realizes what they're doing,

126
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,930
and gives you time to talk.

127
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:03,860
Use that time to calm down and really listen to what the user is saying. Ask yourself.

128
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,950
Why are they talking over me? What am I missing?

129
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,140
Then, in those five to 10 seconds,

130
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,895
collect yourself and think about what you want to say.

131
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:16,780
How can I help you today.

132
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,310
My laptop isn't working.

133
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,050
I need a new one.

134
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,965
I have meetings I need to go to.

135
00:07:21,965 --> 00:07:26,035
I can certainly look into this and see what we can do to fix it.

136
00:07:26,035 --> 00:07:29,870
But I want to set context that our policy is to only replace

137
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,675
laptops if all other options have been exhausted.

138
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:36,395
I don't need you to go snooping around my computer.

139
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:37,640
Just give me a new one.

140
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,880
Gail I'd love to do that for you but.

141
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,290
That's ridiculous. I'm a director.

142
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,150
I should be able to get a new laptop.

143
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,070
I have no time for this.

144
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,810
I completely understand.

145
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:50,933
Can you let me have five minutes to do a quick triage,

146
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:54,020
and then we can discuss next steps.

147
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,650
If the user is crossing the line and making you feel uncomfortable,

148
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,690
ignoring it can feel like the easiest solution. It isn't.

149
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,380
Remember that if you do,

150
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,120
the next person they interact with,

151
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,680
will be treated the same way.

152
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,290
And that's not okay.

153
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:12,395
It's also easy to say the person being attacked needs to stand up for themselves.

154
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:16,000
But in situations like this one, that's really hard.

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,910
Ideally bystanders would call up this behavior in a calm way.

156
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:23,709
It's also important that you escalate these issues to the appropriate channel,

157
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:25,130
whether that's your manager,

158
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,705
the human resources department, whomever.

159
00:08:28,705 --> 00:08:32,353
Disclaimer, I love being in the IT support field,

160
00:08:32,353 --> 00:08:34,405
and I don't want to dwell on the negative.

161
00:08:34,405 --> 00:08:37,515
But I do want to prepare you for what you might encounter.

162
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:40,360
So let me throw another tough scenario at you.

163
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,980
You might find that a user skims over what you wrote,

164
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,000
or doesn't listen to the full instructions you present before taking action.

165
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,600
When this happens, be patient.

166
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,785
You've likely been on the other end of this before when you ignored instructions.

167
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:57,890
Why? Were you overwhelmed with information?

168
00:08:57,890 --> 00:08:59,140
Were you in a hurry?

169
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,900
Maybe you need reading glasses.

170
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,710
Whatever the case might be,

171
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:05,420
the best tactic is to break these steps down

172
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:09,005
into smaller more digestible pieces for the user.

173
00:09:09,005 --> 00:09:12,080
If you sent them an article that they didn't finish reading,

174
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,255
ask where specifically in the documentation they're having issues.

175
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:19,595
So that you don't have to bore them with the parts they already know.

176
00:09:19,595 --> 00:09:21,805
Sometimes you'll come across someone wanting to bend

177
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:25,180
a policy or push back on an established process.

178
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,280
Take this as a sign to look deeper into the situation.

179
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,410
Is it really a company policy,

180
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:32,975
or just a common way of doing things?

181
00:09:32,975 --> 00:09:34,440
If it is the policy,

182
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,960
is there documentation of it?

183
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,045
You can reference that to the user.

184
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:41,810
If not, offer to follow up to get a definitive answer.

185
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:44,025
You might be surprised what you find.

186
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:45,284
The takeaway here is,

187
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:49,385
that it's important to try to see things from other people's point of view.

188
00:09:49,385 --> 00:09:53,525
In that moment, when you're feeling riled up and frustrated,

189
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:57,755
take a minute to see the situation from the other person's perspective.

190
00:09:57,755 --> 00:10:00,505
If you are them, how would you be feeling?

191
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:02,255
What would make you feel better?

192
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:06,060
If you can train yourself to see things from another's perspective,

193
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,120
you're on your way to turning things around.
