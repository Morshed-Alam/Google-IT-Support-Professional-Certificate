1
00:00:12,122 --> 00:00:18,030
Customer service is a critical skill in IT
support, I can't emphasize that enough.

2
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,990
You can have all the technical knowledge
in the world, but if the user had a poor

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:26,480
experience in the process of getting
their issue solved, you failed.

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,817
The techniques we'll discuss in these
videos won't only help you with

5
00:00:29,817 --> 00:00:30,435
your users.

6
00:00:30,435 --> 00:00:33,700
They'll help you work better with
your peers, you managers, and

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,770
maybe even your own
personal relationships.

8
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:41,130
Keep in mind, these techniques
don't work in all situations.

9
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:45,040
The reality is that no matter how
great you are at customer service,

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,960
some situations don't
have a good resolution.

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,860
Plus everyone is different, so

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,080
you'll need to tweak your style
when working with users, but

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,040
the techniques we'll cover are intended to
make your IT interactions more successful.

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,020
In IT support, you work with users to fix
technology and improve how people use it.

15
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,860
To accomplish this, you need to develop
a trust between you and the user.

16
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,570
Lots of employers believe
that good customer service

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,510
also builds brand loyalty,
which is a key to success.

18
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,870
These lessons are meant to give
you the foundational skills and

19
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,550
techniques of how to deliver
great customer service.

20
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,050
Customer service practices can
differ from company to company.

21
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:29,030
So while we'll cover the key concepts of
customer service in any IT support role,

22
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,870
it's important to talk with your
employer to understand the company's

23
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,390
customer service approach.

24
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,120
This will also give you
an idea of how much freedom or

25
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,312
restrictions you might have in the role.

26
00:01:38,312 --> 00:01:39,800
Spoiler alert,

27
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,800
great customer service requires exhibiting
empathy, being conscious of your tone,

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:49,120
acknowledging the person you're talking
to and developing trust with the user.

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,910
If you remember nothing else from this
lesson, remember those four things.

30
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,430
The most important of
all of these is empathy.

31
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,260
What's the difference between sympathy and
empathy?

32
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,550
People will say things like
sympathy is saying you're sorry,

33
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,370
empathy is feeling sorry.

34
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,070
That doesn't really explain it.

35
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,375
So let's use an example
to drive this home.

36
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,959
If someone fell into a dark,
damp, dirty hole, and

37
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,217
you leaned over with a sad expression and
said,

38
00:02:15,217 --> 00:02:20,760
that must be a really tough situation,
then you're expressing sympathy.

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,040
You're sharing their feelings, but
you aren't experiencing those feelings.

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,800
If you crawled down into that dark, damp,
dirty hole with the person who fell and

41
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,890
said, this is a really tough situation,
then you're expressing empathy.

42
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,760
You're able to see something from
someone else's perspective and

43
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,630
understand their feelings.

44
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:45,080
The word choice between the two
situations is very similar.

45
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,220
But the action, the action you take by
looking at it from their perspective,

46
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,670
is what empathy is all about.

47
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,470
Some days it's hard to empathize,
I know from experience.

48
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:59,162
Maybe you had an argument
with a loved one before work.

49
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:02,389
And by the end of the day,
you find yourself getting annoyed or

50
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:03,900
upset with users.

51
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,440
That's the moment when empathy
becomes the most important,

52
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,750
because anyone can showcase
empathy when it's easy.

53
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:16,360
But someone who persistently displays
empathy will stand out as a kinder human,

54
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,810
and a more professional and
effective employee.

55
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:23,170
Once you have empathy down,
you should think of your tone.

56
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,270
Tone is historically thought
of as how you speak out loud.

57
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,660
In this technological age, when many
of our interactions are over text, and

58
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,510
IT support is increasingly done remotely,

59
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,850
tone isn't just about how you come
off during an in-person conversation.

60
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:43,060
It's expanded into how you write,
punctuate, and even spell.

61
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,610
If your tone is short or blunt, then the
user will feel brushed off and devalued.

62
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:51,070
But if your tone is friendly and curious,

63
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:55,170
the user is much more likely to have
a positive experience working with you.

64
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,900
Be careful not to go overboard
with the friendliness though,

65
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,870
it could be disingenuous.

66
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,340
Communicating a good tone
is a delicate balance.

67
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,690
How you ask a question and how you
respond to a user's question matters.

68
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,440
Let's say you tell a user in an email,
turn your computer off and

69
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,770
on again and it will start working.

70
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,550
They'll probably never respond.

71
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,370
And your company may have lost a customer,
because the tone is just too short and

72
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,840
pretty unfriendly.

73
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,560
While it gets to the point, it doesn't
leave the door open to conversation.

74
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,130
What if instead you wrote,
please try turning your computer off and

75
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,310
back on again.

76
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:34,200
This should update the change we made and
fix the problem.

77
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,560
If that doesn't work, just let me know.

78
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,830
It's a little wordier, but it has
a better tone of asking versus telling.

79
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:44,960
Inviting them back to connect with
you in case the issue isn't resolved,

80
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,070
leaves the lines of communication open.

81
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,840
Tone can be especially difficult
when you're supporting someone in

82
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,750
a different region or country.

83
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,460
Make sure to familiarize yourself with
the local style, whether that's more

84
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,650
conversational or direct, and adjust
your style depending on the audience.

85
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,020
In this day and age of text and email,
it's easy to ignore what someone says.

86
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,070
If a comment seems like a dig, or

87
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:11,610
it's just too much information provided,
we tend to shy away from responding.

88
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,785
It's also really common to forget to
tell the user what you're doing while

89
00:05:14,785 --> 00:05:19,200
you're troubleshooting, that might leave
the user waiting in an awkward silence.

90
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,160
Whenever possible, acknowledge the user.

91
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,550
This reduces the tension
that might build and

92
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,190
helps you understand how you're
working toward a solution.

93
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,580
Let's say your chatting back and
forth with the user,

94
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,800
you're asking a lot of questions
to better troubleshoot the issue.

95
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,270
The user's answering them, but also makes
comment like, jeez, I already answered

96
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,700
these in my last email, or, I just
want to know what's causing my problem.

97
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,380
You choose to ignore this and
continue on with your troubleshooting.

98
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,820
You think you're close to
solving the problem and

99
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,370
these side comments
are just a distraction.

100
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,720
But then the user stops
fully engaging with you and

101
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,230
only gives you half-answers
to your questions.

102
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,310
Now you're not able to
solve the issue at all.

103
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:01,930
The user's unhappy, you're unhappy and
the company's unhappy.

104
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:03,460
It's a bad situation.

105
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:07,390
Instead of ignoring the user in that
situation, you could have said,

106
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:09,370
I'm sorry for asking these questions,

107
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,410
sometimes repeating them will
help new information pop up.

108
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,193
Or, you could have said,
sorry for the repeat questions.

109
00:06:16,193 --> 00:06:19,922
I don't want to give you a superficial
cause, when we could fix the root issue,

110
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,310
and you won't have to chat with us again.

111
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:26,930
This helps them to understand your
method and become part of the solution.

112
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,370
It's important to acknowledge your own
actions if you think they might otherwise

113
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,510
confuse the user.

114
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:34,080
Let's say a user contacts
you to fix something.

115
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,030
After collecting some information,
you go radio silent.

116
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,621
What's the user to do?

117
00:06:38,621 --> 00:06:40,422
Would they ask if you're still there?

118
00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:43,700
Would they wait awkwardly until
you came back on the line?

119
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,210
How long would they wait before
ending the call or saying something?

120
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,940
How would they feel about their
interaction with you, pretty awkward.

121
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,480
But what if you said,
I need to do some research on this issue,

122
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,720
would you mind waiting about five
minutes or less while I do that?

123
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,310
They'd probably say, sure, and
keep themselves occupied while they wait.

124
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:04,580
They'd also feel more confident in
your ability to resolve the issue.

125
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,340
This leads to the most important thing to
remember when working with people, and

126
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,710
that's developing trust.

127
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,360
This is easy to do if
you have repeat users.

128
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,380
They see you every workday.

129
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:20,010
One bad day isn't going to stop them from
trusting that you know what you're doing.

130
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:24,570
But in a transactional userbase, where
the user only contacts the company once or

131
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:29,850
twice, how you interact with each
user each time is going to break or

132
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,400
build that trust.

133
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,320
Why is trust so important?

134
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,130
Without it, the user could be
difficult to work with and

135
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,290
could even ignore your advice completely.

136
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,120
Empathy and acknowledgement
are a big part of building trust.

137
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,190
Without these, you'll find it
difficult to connect with the user.

138
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,870
By seeing things from
the user's perspective,

139
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,080
you're more likely to find the solution
that will help them specifically.

140
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,500
This lets them know that you care, and

141
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,610
they'll be more likely to be
engaged in the interaction.

142
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:01,310
It's also important to follow through
on your commitments and promises.

143
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:03,930
If you tell someone you're
going to follow up in one hour,

144
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,397
then be sure to make it happen.

145
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:09,450
And if you don't,
acknowledge the oversight and apologize.

146
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,450
Be sure that any claims
you make can be backed up.

147
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,170
Don't make something up to a user, because
you think it'll help in the moment.

148
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,060
Be honest with the user, even if you
think they won't be happy about it.

149
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,544
And never be afraid to
admit when you're wrong.

150
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:25,300
This might be the hardest
thing to do with a user, but

151
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,460
you'll find that your interactions
a more successful this way.

152
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:33,410
Being specific and empathetic with your
apologies will give it more meaning.

153
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,829
And remember,
no one wakes up in the morning thinking,

154
00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:38,512
I'm going to be a jerk today.

155
00:08:38,512 --> 00:08:40,952
While you shouldn't
sacrifice your self respect,

156
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:44,340
do your best to give the user the benefit
of the doubt whenever possible.
