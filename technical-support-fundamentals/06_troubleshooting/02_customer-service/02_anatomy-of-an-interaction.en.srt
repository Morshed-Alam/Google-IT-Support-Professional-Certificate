1
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:16,470
Now that we've covered the main customer
service techniques, we're going to dive in

2
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,830
to some of the nitty gritty by looking
at the anatomy of an interaction.

3
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,265
These apply to any channel of IT
support email, phone, chat, or

4
00:00:25,265 --> 00:00:27,250
in-person interactions.

5
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,640
From the first moment you
interact with someone

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,050
it's important to think
about how you say hello.

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,210
Do you make sure to tell them your name?

8
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,550
Do you incorporate information you
know about them in your greeting?

9
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,247
Do you ensure a positive tone?

10
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:43,640
Are your spelling and grammar on point?

11
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,540
These are all ways to create a really
good start to the interaction.

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,940
Some of these things
are hard to achieve though.

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:53,500
I'm a horrible speller,
especially when I'm in a hurry.

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,320
But knowing some of these
trouble spots ahead of time

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,970
will let you find ways to address
them before the interaction.

16
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,620
For me, I know that when I'm in a hurry

17
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,960
I need to re check my
spelling before hitting send.

18
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,474
Have you ever heard the phrase
first impressions last a lifetime.

19
00:01:09,474 --> 00:01:14,240
While that may be a bit of
an exaggeration it touches on some truth.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,510
How you first interact with someone
will influence how the rest of

21
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,710
the interaction plays out.

22
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:22,830
I'm not saying it has to
be over the top gushy and

23
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,300
nice, that might have the opposite effect.

24
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,980
Just be professional, acknowledge
the user, and show them some respect.

25
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:34,104
Taking the time to get the interaction off
to a good start will make everything that

26
00:01:34,104 --> 00:01:35,193
comes after easier.

27
00:01:35,193 --> 00:01:38,000
Let's check out two scenarios
to see how this plays out.

28
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,630
>> Hi Gayle, how are you doing?

29
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,870
>> Not great, it's been a bad day
trying to get my phone fixed.

30
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,765
>> What's wrong with your phone?

31
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:53,920
>> Hi Gayle, how are you today.

32
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,650
>> Not great, it's been a bad day
trying to get my phone fixed.

33
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,340
>> Sorry to hear that.

34
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,810
Let's see what we can
do to turn that around.

35
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,800
>> Just by acknowledging their feelings
and demonstrat your desire to help them,

36
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,440
you've started to build
a relationship with the user.

37
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,570
Of course you have to keep up the good
work throughout the interaction, but

38
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:16,530
laying the ground work is
an important first step.

39
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,260
And remember that while you might have
a hundred issues in the ticket queue that

40
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,760
need your attention.

41
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:27,220
This is the only one that matters to the
user, so show them it's your priority too.

42
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,540
The next critical step in an interaction
is how you respond to the users questions.

43
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,660
If they are taking the time to explain to
you what happened, but you brush off their

44
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:40,900
concerns by acting uninterested,
things are going to go south fast.

45
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,390
Remember to integrate the information
you've been given into your conversation.

46
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,380
This will show you're
actively listening and

47
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,530
can help them feel more
connected to the interaction.

48
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,590
Let's look at an example.

49
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,460
Which one of these greetings do
you think is the most effective?

50
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,740
Greeting one.

51
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,460
Hi Rhori, how are you today?

52
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,310
What can I help you with?

53
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,660
Or greeting number two.

54
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,410
Hi Rhori, I hope you're having a good day,

55
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,910
despite your computer
randomly turning off.

56
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,450
Let's see what we can
do to fix your issue.

57
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,900
It's important to be
transparent with the user.

58
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,540
If they start asking you a bunch
of questions while you're still

59
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,010
troubleshooting, you can do two things.

60
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,050
First option, you could ignore them
because they're just talking out loud.

61
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:29,040
Second option, you can pause and
say something like, I'd be happy to answer

62
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,310
all of your questions but
I want to look up this one first.

63
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,450
I've written them all down though.

64
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,100
So I won't forget them.

65
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,650
If you say that,
make sure to write the questions down.

66
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,570
To really build a rapport, try to remember
a personal fact that they've mentioned and

67
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,090
bring it up later.

68
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,150
Maybe they mentioned they loved cats.

69
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,320
Later while you're waiting for something
to load, ask them if they have any cats or

70
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,850
what their cats name is.

71
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:56,400
This shouldn't be forced so if you're not
the type to engage in small talk, skip it.

72
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,330
Now you're getting to the point
where you're ready to troubleshoot.

73
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:03,490
Just make sure you clarify the person's
issue before you start to troubleshoot.

74
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,510
If you don't, you might find
yourself going down a rabbit hole.

75
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:10,350
Imagine that a user tells you
their computer can't get online.

76
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,960
So you look at the IP address,
DNS configuration,

77
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,250
and you start paying things with no luck.

78
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,920
Everything seems fine.

79
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,050
Then, 20 minutes later you find
out their machine is online,

80
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,510
they just can't access a particular page.

81
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,070
Had you clarified this at the start
you would have saved yourself, and

82
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,980
the user 20 minutes.

83
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,330
It seems simple to clarify the problem
space, but it's often overlooked.

84
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:35,330
Take this example.

85
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:39,600
>> Thank you for calling, this is Lian.

86
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,000
How can I help you?

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,670
>> Hi Lian, my computer isn't working.

88
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,810
>> That doesn't sound fun.

89
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,890
What do you mean by
the computer isn't working?

90
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,910
>> It won't connect to the Internet.

91
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,700
>> Do you have the corporate password for
the wifi?

92
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,390
>> No, why do I need that?

93
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,470
>> In order to connect to
the wifi in the building,

94
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,660
you need to use the corporate password.

95
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,040
>> Well, I'm not in the building.

96
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,576
I'm at a cafe.

97
00:05:04,915 --> 00:05:09,740
>> That's odd, your computer seems to
be different than what we normally use.

98
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,700
Can I get your name so
I can look up your configuration?

99
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,064
>> Ling Chan.

100
00:05:16,064 --> 00:05:17,420
>> Do you work at this company?

101
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,680
>> No, my friend gave me the number.

102
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:27,090
>> Problem solving is a super important
aspect of an IT support interaction.

103
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,808
Being an IT support specialist means that
you could can be asked about anything.

104
00:05:31,808 --> 00:05:35,358
Even though you aren't expected to know
the answer off the top of your head,

105
00:05:35,358 --> 00:05:38,290
you should know where to
start looking to find it.

106
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,140
People are coming to you because they
have a problem they can't fix themselves.

107
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,390
Sometimes they feel self-conscious
about asking for help, so

108
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,930
be aware of how you probe for information.

109
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,820
Pummeling the user with
question after question

110
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,910
will probably create
frustration on both sides.

111
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:58,110
Make sure to set context and
explain why you're asking the question.

112
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,880
Saying something simple like, in order for
me to figure out what' really going on,

113
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,600
I need to ask you some question,
can make all the difference.

114
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,820
When you're in person things are a lot
easier because you can see each other, and

115
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,200
read each other's expression but
you might find yourself too comfortable.

116
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:18,660
Imagine you're asking for help with
your phone, you wouldn't want the person

117
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,940
helping you to just take it out
of your hands without asking.

118
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:25,810
So make sure you tell the user what
you're doing before you do it.

119
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:29,600
If you're supporting a user remotely and
need them to run some commands,

120
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,060
don't forget to tell them why you
need them to execute the commands.

121
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,480
There's no need to go
into a ton of detail But

122
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,220
without some context you could
strain the trust you've built.

123
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,370
Make sure that when you're
asking these questions or

124
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,910
asking the user to run a command you're
really listening to the response.

125
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,880
Those little nuggets of information
may help solve the issue.

126
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,200
The last five minutes of
the interaction will set the tone for

127
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,360
how the user feels walking
away from the interaction.

128
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,860
So, make sure to end on a positive note.

129
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,580
You might have solved their issue, but
if they don't feel it was resolved or

130
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,580
their unsure of the next steps,

131
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,160
then they're going to walk away
feeling like it was a poor solution.

132
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,690
So how do you make
a good final impression?

133
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,250
Simple, reiterate the resolution.

134
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,910
State the next steps.

135
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,834
Then, ask the user if
they have any questions.
