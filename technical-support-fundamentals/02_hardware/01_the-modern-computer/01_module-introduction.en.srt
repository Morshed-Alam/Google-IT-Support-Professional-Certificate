1
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,100
Isn't the history of
computers super interesting?

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,460
I love going back in time and

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,070
seeing how we got to this
exciting point in computing.

4
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:21,480
You've already taken the first few steps
to building your foundational knowledge of

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,920
IT, and before we dive deeper, I'd like
to take a moment to introduce myself.

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,400
My name is Devan Sri-Tharan,
I've been working in IT for ten years.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,620
I'm a Corporate Operations Engineer
at Google,

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,680
where I get to tackle challenging and
complex IT issues.

9
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,110
Thinking back, my first experience with
tech began when I was about nine years

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,390
old, when my dad brought home
the family's first computer.

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,170
I remember my dad holding
a floppy disk and

12
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,030
telling me that there was a game on it.

13
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:47,180
To my dad's amazement I somehow
managed to copy the game from disk

14
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,900
onto the computer's hard drive.

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,220
While it might seem like a trivial
task now, this devise was just so

16
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,476
new to us back then.

17
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:56,879
Sure, I loved the different games I
could play, but what I really loved was

18
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,084
tinkering with the machine, trying to
get it to do what I want it to do.

19
00:01:00,084 --> 00:01:04,895
While that floppy disk computer might have
ignited my passion for technology, it

20
00:01:04,895 --> 00:01:10,650
was actually my first few job experiences
that really started to shape my IT career.

21
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,098
One was in retail,
[LAUGH] selling baby furniture and

22
00:01:13,098 --> 00:01:16,990
the other was at a postal store, where I
helped customers ship their packages, and

23
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:18,790
became the one person IT crew.

24
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:22,330
It might sound odd that working
in retail inspired my career, but

25
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,350
I've realized I really enjoy
communicating with customers,

26
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,430
try to understand their needs and
offering a solution.

27
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,360
My first experience working
directly in IT was in college

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,920
as an IT support specialist intern.

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,645
From there, I worked as an IT consultant
to decommission an entire IT environment.

30
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:42,353
This was my first experience working
directly with large IT infrastructure, and

31
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:45,455
pushing myself outside my comfort
level as a college student.

32
00:01:45,455 --> 00:01:47,995
I bring up these few jobs for a reason.

33
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:51,535
These experiences helped
shape my career in IT.

34
00:01:51,535 --> 00:01:54,703
I knew at that time that I
wanted to go into tech, but

35
00:01:54,703 --> 00:01:57,594
I struggled where I wanted
to focus my career.

36
00:01:57,594 --> 00:02:01,656
Starting at Google as an IT journalist
allowed me to experience many different

37
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:02,830
areas of technology.

38
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,530
It allowed me to figure out
the jobs I didn't want to do,

39
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,356
before I was able to identify
exactly what I did want to do.

40
00:02:08,356 --> 00:02:10,476
Really passionate about IT infrastructure,
but

41
00:02:10,476 --> 00:02:13,910
you can't understand infrastructure
until you understand hardware.

42
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,910
So let's dig in.

43
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,180
In IT, hardware is an essenential
topic to understand.

44
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,590
You might find yourself
replacing faulty components or

45
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,360
even upgrading an entire
fleet of machines one day.

46
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,558
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able
to describe all the physical parts of

47
00:02:26,558 --> 00:02:28,163
a computer and how they work together.

48
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:30,457
You'll even be able to
build your own computer.

49
00:02:30,457 --> 00:02:32,557
Once you figure out how
one computer works,

50
00:02:32,557 --> 00:02:35,810
you'll be able to understand
how any type of computer works.

51
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,720
Excited?
I am, let's get started.
