1
00:00:11,663 --> 00:00:14,660
Let's face it, computers are everywhere.

2
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,610
You come into contact with them at home,
work, the airport,

3
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:22,740
the grocery store, you're using some
type of computer to take this course.

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,620
You know what?

5
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,150
There's probably one in
your pocket right now.

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,130
While computers are complex and
can seem daunting to learn,

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,560
they ultimately just calculate,
process, and store data.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,760
In this lesson, we're going to take
a peek at what's inside of the computer.

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,267
We'll spend the next few
lessons explaining how each of

10
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:40,396
these components work.

11
00:00:40,396 --> 00:00:43,995
But for now,
let's check out a typical desktop setup.

12
00:00:43,995 --> 00:00:47,850
Desktops are just computers that
can fit on or under our desks.

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,950
So here we have a monitor,
a keyboard, a mouse, and a desktop.

14
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,650
Sometimes you might even add a webcam,
speakers, or a printer set up.

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,084
We'll call these physical components,
hardware.

16
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:03,645
Let's take a look at
the back of the computer.

17
00:01:10,618 --> 00:01:15,049
You can see common connectors here,
the power outlet here, and

18
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:17,320
the common ports here.

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,510
Ports are connection points that
we can connect devices to that

20
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,190
extend the functionality of our computer.

21
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,550
We're going to detail about the ports
you see here in a later lesson.

22
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,240
But here's a quick rundown.

23
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,810
We have a port here to
connect to a monitor, and

24
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,740
a few ports here to plug your keyboard and
mouse.

25
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,180
There's another important one here for
our network connection.

26
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,830
With just these ports,

27
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,370
we're able to have the basic functionality
to browse the web and much more.

28
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,070
Things look pretty similar in a laptop.

29
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,797
Here are some of the same ports.

30
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:56,670
A built-in monitor, And a keyboard.

31
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,860
There are also physical components inside
the laptop case that are hidden for

32
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,040
portability.

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,330
Once you figure out how
one computer works,

34
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,760
you can figure out how
any other computer works.

35
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,180
Okay, this is my favorite part.

36
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:13,570
Let's open up this desktop and
take a deeper look.

37
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,765
Let me first clean up my desk.

38
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:23,609
Get ready for it.

39
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,890
Whoa, it looks pretty complicated,
but that's okay.

40
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,970
We'll take you through it.

41
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,660
Let's start with a quick tour.

42
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,020
Then we'll dive deeper into each
of these parts in the next lesson.

43
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,980
Right here, this component,
it's a CPU or central processing unit,

44
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,470
which is covered by this heat sink.

45
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:47,790
You could think of the CPU as
the brain of our computer.

46
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,660
The CPU does all the calculations and
data processing.

47
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,560
It communicates pretty heavily
with this component right here,

48
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,420
RAM or Random Access Memory.

49
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,870
RAM is our computer's short-term memory.

50
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,077
We use this component when we
want to store data temporarily.

51
00:03:05,077 --> 00:03:08,557
Like let's say,
you're typing something into a chat or

52
00:03:08,557 --> 00:03:10,741
a piece of text in a word processor.

53
00:03:10,741 --> 00:03:13,460
This information is stored in the RAM.

54
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,720
Don't worry, we'll cram in more
details on RAM in the later lesson.

55
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,400
When we want to store
anything in long-term memory,

56
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,340
we use this component here,
the hard drive.

57
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,110
The hard drive holds all of our data,

58
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:31,200
which can include music,
pictures, applications.

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,250
Let me show you something
else interesting.

60
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,300
Have you noticed this large slab here?

61
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,280
This is our motherboard.

62
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,230
It holds everything in place and lets our
components communicate with each other.

63
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,620
It's the foundation of our computer.

64
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,320
You can think of
the motherboard as the body or

65
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,400
circulatory system of the computer
that connects all the pieces together.

66
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,180
The last component we'll talk about
is our power supply, which converts

67
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,750
electricity from our wall outlet onto
a format that our computer can use.

68
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,980
You know what's interesting?

69
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:07,540
All these components make up most
computers, even a mobile phone.

70
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,810
While it might look very different from
your laptop, a mobile phone just uses

71
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,740
a smaller version of the hardware that
we saw in the desktop and laptop today.

72
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,345
So now that we've covered
the basic anatomy of the computer,

73
00:04:18,345 --> 00:04:22,990
we'll go over each of these components
in depths in the next few lessons.

74
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,630
Understanding how computer hardware works
is a really helpful skill set in IT

75
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,410
support, since an IT department maintains
the hardware that a company uses.

76
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,290
A solid understanding of these computer
internals will come in handy when

77
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,900
troubleshooting hardware related problems,
and

78
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,100
taking things apart to see how
they work is just super fine.
