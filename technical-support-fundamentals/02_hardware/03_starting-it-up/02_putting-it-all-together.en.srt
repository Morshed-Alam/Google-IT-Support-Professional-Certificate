1
00:00:11,902 --> 00:00:15,403
Now that we've learned what
the computer components are and

2
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:20,081
how they work we're going to assemble our
very own computer, a full size desktop.

3
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:25,000
Computers are incredibly fundamental to
the work of an IT support specialist.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,700
There used in pretty much
every aspect of the job.

5
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,220
Aside from work, knowing how to build
a computer might inspire you to try

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,900
all kinds of cool stuff.

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,490
You could custom build a gaming rig to
play the most advanced game at the highest

8
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,410
setting or like me make a home media
server for all you photos and videos.

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,190
Knowing how to build a computer
is a skill that can be useful in

10
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,790
lots of interesting ways.

11
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,600
Before we get started,
let's lay down some ground rules for

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,930
this ground up build, sorry,
I cannot help myself.

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,930
We should think about
electrostatic discharge and

14
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,960
try to prevent unwanted static from
harming our very expensive components.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,270
Have you ever rubbed yourself socks on a
carpet and then accidentally zap someone?

16
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,940
That's pretty harmless, but
if you that to your new motherboard,

17
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:12,040
you completely destroy it.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,650
So how do we prevent static discharge?

19
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,730
We can go about this in two ways,

20
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:21,410
we can touch in our two device that's
plugged in but not powered on.

21
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:26,220
FYI, you should do this every couple of
minutes when assembling a new computer.

22
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,713
Another option is to wear an anti-static
wristband like the one I have here,

23
00:01:29,713 --> 00:01:30,369
let me get it.

24
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,030
You connect the end of the clip to
a non-painted metal surface like your

25
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,150
computer.

26
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,090
And then you separate on to your hands and
wallah your done.

27
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:46,720
While we are on the subject
of anti-static safety,

28
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,380
I want to call out that when
you buy computer parts,

29
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,640
they'll come in anti-static bags to
prevent accidental static electricity.

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,130
Be sure to keep them inside the bags until
you need to install them on your computer.

31
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,720
Now, let's get making this computer, we'll
start by laying down the foundation of our

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,530
computer, the motherboard.

33
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:12,230
Remember, there are lots of different
form factors for motherboards and

34
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,470
you want to make sure the one you
purchase fits your computer case.

35
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:22,390
We purchased the full size desktop cased
and have a full size ATX motherboard.

36
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:25,590
On the motherboard there
are a lot of screw holes

37
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,030
which coincide with the holes
in the desktop case too.

38
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,760
You want to match up the holes on the
motherboard to the holes on the desktop.

39
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,020
Once you figure out which holes
to use screw in standoffs.

40
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,940
Standoffs are used to raise and
attach your motherboard to the case.

41
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:45,340
In this instance our case
has built in standoffs.

42
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,081
Let's start start adding on components.

43
00:03:38,455 --> 00:03:40,630
Let's start by adding our components in.

44
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:44,249
We'll start with the CPU, so let's
take that out of our anti-static bag.

45
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:48,216
You want to be very careful with these
because they're very expensive, and

46
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:49,233
you don't want to drop them.

47
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:59,240
Once we've taken out the bag, let's line
up the CPU with the motherboard's socket.

48
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,410
Something to note is
this marker right here.

49
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,735
This has to align with the CPU
socket on the motherboard.

50
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:11,240
Also don't forget to make sure you get
compatible CPU that fit your motherboard.

51
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,740
We have a LGA CPU and
an LGA-compatible motherboard socket.

52
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,518
So let's go ahead and align
the correct orientation of the CPU and

53
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,244
secure it in place like this.

54
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,138
So like mentioned before,

55
00:04:26,138 --> 00:04:31,070
you want to make sure that the pointers
on the CPU and the socket are aligned.

56
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,690
The easy part is putting the CPU in.

57
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:40,690
The fun part is securing this,
just note that when you secure

58
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,460
the CPU in the socket you do need to use
a bit of force so it's tightly secured in.

59
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:54,540
Perfect, so
now the CPU is secured in the socket.

60
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,200
Now that our CPU is in place we need
to add our heat sink on top of it.

61
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,538
The heat sink is used to
dissipate heat from our CPU.

62
00:05:02,538 --> 00:05:04,663
I want to show you some cool things.

63
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:10,250
This part right here, this is what
our CPU relies on to stay cool.

64
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,990
It takes the heat from there and
then uses this fan to blow it out.

65
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,270
Before we attach the heat sink, we need
to apply an even amount of thermal paste.

66
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,470
Let me get that,
this is the thermal paste.

67
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,800
Thermal paste is used to better
connect our CPU and heat sink.

68
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,270
So the heat transfers
from to the other better.

69
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,520
To get started,
apply a dab of thermal paste and

70
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,230
spread evenly with a flat object.

71
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,940
Lets do that on our CPU right here.

72
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:49,032
So first thing that you want to

73
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:53,929
do is slowly apply a slight

74
00:05:53,929 --> 00:05:58,166
dab on the CPU like so.

75
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:02,494
Then with the flat object,
apply the thermal paste evenly

76
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:07,540
throughout your CPU to go half way
right here, half way right here,

77
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:13,190
Half way right here, and
then half way right here.

78
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,590
Just make sure that it spread
evenly throughout the CPU.

79
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:22,876
You may have to do this multiple
times to get this correct.

80
00:06:27,985 --> 00:06:33,386
Okay, so once you have that in place,
you're going to tank your heat sink and

81
00:06:33,386 --> 00:06:36,660
then you're going to
press it against the CPU.

82
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,620
And something to note is that
these screws right here,

83
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,540
they align with the CPU socket.

84
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:46,535
So that can guide you while
you put the heat sink on.

85
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:06,259
Great, once you have all
four sockets aligned,

86
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,946
go ahead and get your screw driver and
then tighten down the sockets.

87
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:21,594
So one thing to do, is to make sure that
you screw the opposite sides first so

88
00:07:21,594 --> 00:07:24,665
you know that the heat
sink is attached securely.

89
00:07:37,203 --> 00:07:41,663
So one thing I like to do again is
just kind of go over my screws to

90
00:07:41,663 --> 00:07:45,082
make sure everything
is tightened securely.

91
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:04,910
Great, now that our screws are tightly
on in our heat sink secured

92
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:10,070
to the CPU You have to plug
this Molex to the motherboard.

93
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,508
This is important because this is
what controls the fan speed via

94
00:08:14,508 --> 00:08:15,833
the motherboard.

95
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:19,660
Perfect.

96
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:25,300
So now, you've fully installed and
connected your CPU to the motherboard.

97
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,830
Next, lessons to our RAM.

98
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,620
Located DIMM slots on your motherboard.

99
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,670
So, these are the DIMM slots
like we discussed before.

100
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:37,630
I have four slots available here and
I have four RAM sticks.

101
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,290
Let me pick those up.

102
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:44,545
These are my RAM sticks, and
of course, they're in my anti-static

103
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:49,756
bag Let's take them out.

104
00:09:00,346 --> 00:09:04,135
So, as I mentioned before, this build,
we're going to use DDR3 RAM.

105
00:09:06,304 --> 00:09:10,592
All right, one thing I like to do before
I install my RAM is to make sure that I

106
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,704
align these slots with my RAM slots so

107
00:09:12,704 --> 00:09:17,540
that way I'm not going to be forcing
those in when it's time to install.

108
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,980
So, if you see right here,
your slots are right in the middle so

109
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,040
something I do is before I put it in,
just visually make sure that you got

110
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,270
this right and then align the rest of your
RAM sticks to the same position like this.

111
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,107
You just want to go like this.

112
00:09:34,205 --> 00:09:36,622
Like this.

113
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,423
And like this.

114
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:44,838
That way, you're not going to be damaging
your pins if you pick your RAM sticks up

115
00:09:44,838 --> 00:09:46,199
and accidentally force it in.

116
00:09:51,243 --> 00:09:54,446
So now we've got that, we're going to
put this in this slot right here.

117
00:09:57,586 --> 00:10:01,720
Line up the pins correctly and
push in the RAM until you hear it click.

118
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,880
You'll know it's secure when both
sides of the RAMs are locked in place.

119
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,360
And there's something
else you should know.

120
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,820
Your slots right here,
they are both black and white.

121
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,836
We're going to stick to
using the white slots.

122
00:10:20,928 --> 00:10:22,341
This too.

123
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,801
And we're also going to
put this one right here.

124
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:46,715
There you go.
You've securely fastened

125
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:48,860
your RAM inside your motherboard.

126
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,030
Next, we have our hard drive.

127
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:58,300
In this example, we're using an SSD SATA
hard drive instead of a HDD.

128
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,645
We just need to use one SATA cable
to connect it to our motherboard.

129
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,761
So, first, I'm going to go ahead and
slot this in this cage

130
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:13,750
This is going to vary from case to case,
but this one's going to be easy.

131
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,515
All we have to,
we just slide it in like so.

132
00:11:15,515 --> 00:11:20,567
And normally you will hear a click,
[SOUND] Like that.

133
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:21,618
Once that's in,

134
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:25,840
we just need to use one SATA cable to
connect our SSD to our motherboard.

135
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,810
Let me go and get that.

136
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,410
So here we go.

137
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,670
Here's a SATA cable.

138
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:35,818
So what I'm going to do, is I'm
going to connect this end to our SSD.

139
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,786
I'm going to connect this
end to our motherboard.

140
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:48,411
There we go, it's in.

141
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:54,600
Remember, SATA cables
can only go in one way.

142
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,250
So now that we have our SSD installed,
let's go ahead and install our case fan.

143
00:12:00,282 --> 00:12:02,600
And this is how this looks like.

144
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,580
One thing to note is the small x.

145
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:10,470
You're going to go ahead and find a label
on your motherboard that says, rear fans.

146
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,005
Not all motherboards have this, but
in this example, we do have that, so

147
00:12:14,005 --> 00:12:14,510
just to note.

148
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,910
We get those into the grooves,
there you go.

149
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:30,800
My fan's installed, and now I'm going to
go ahead and attach this to the Molex.

150
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,290
There we go,
now my fan is attached to my motherboard.

151
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:40,740
For best practice, you want to create
a wind tunnel that takes in air,

152
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,420
blows it over your components,
and then pushes it all out back.

153
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,980
Check out how our heat
sink has a fan on it too.

154
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,130
That's pretty normal,
since our CPU generates a lot of heat, and

155
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,490
we want to help cool it
off as best as we can.

156
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,850
We're almost done.

157
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:59,670
Now, we're going to connect our power and
test to see if everything's working.

158
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,000
So let's grab our power supply.

159
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:03,430
Here we are.

160
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:09,790
First, let's secure our
power supply to our case.

161
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,310
Be careful not to damage
the motherboard when you install it.

162
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,767
What you're going to do is you're going to
put this in slowly like that, And

163
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:22,641
then just slide it in.

164
00:13:22,641 --> 00:13:23,800
There you go.

165
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,140
One thing I like to do, is I'd like to put
my cables all the way out to the side, so

166
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,740
like I mentioned before, it's not going to
go ahead and damage the motherboard.

167
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,660
So now, I'm going to go ahead and
start securing our power supply.

168
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,383
Its always fun getting in.

169
00:13:39,383 --> 00:13:41,891
There we go

170
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:52,508
So as you can see, I normally like
to go and start with my fingers, so

171
00:13:52,508 --> 00:13:53,630
it's easier to get in.

172
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,715
And once I put all my screws in,
I'm going to go ahead and

173
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:04,222
use my screw driver and
fasten it, tighten that.

174
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,940
There you go.

175
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,290
So let's go ahead and
tighten our screws right here.

176
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:32,283
[INAUDIBLE] And four.

177
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:33,275
Great.

178
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:36,213
So now, we've secured our
power supply to the case so

179
00:14:36,213 --> 00:14:38,400
it's not going to move anywhere.

180
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,900
And just another note,
you can also install the power supply

181
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,120
before adding it to the motherboard,
depending on how your case is laid out.

182
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,718
Lets go back to our massive connectors.

183
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,870
There are a few things I
would like to highlight.

184
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,810
This big one right here, this is
the one that powers our motherboard.

185
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,020
Another one that we have, it's more of
a legacy one is this four pin Molex.

186
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,550
These connectors were used
heavily before SATA came out.

187
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,709
Now, we use these connectors to power
majority of the SATA devices today.

188
00:15:17,422 --> 00:15:21,518
Most modern machines today will
probably use SATA power connectors for

189
00:15:21,518 --> 00:15:25,220
your hard drives so that it may
come with Molex to SATA adapters.

190
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,080
Now, it's time for the fun part.

191
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,490
First, let's go ahead and connect
our power supply to our motherboard.

192
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,760
So that's this big pin
as we discussed earlier.

193
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,050
It's going to go in right here.

194
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:42,703
And plug that in like so.

195
00:15:45,866 --> 00:15:53,405
Next, we're going to go ahead and power
the CPU, with this A pin Molex right here.

196
00:15:53,405 --> 00:15:56,770
It's [INAUDIBLE] pretty tight, but
you should be able to get it in.

197
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:07,360
There you go.

198
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,190
So what we just did was we have the power
supply that is powering the motherboard

199
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,980
and the CPU.

200
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,410
So now that we've hooked up the cable
to our CPU and motherboard,

201
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:21,990
the next thing that we need to hook up are
these cables that are sitting in our case.

202
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:25,240
This is going to vary from case to case,
but let's go through it.

203
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,976
Some of these cables are used for
your case's patterns and lights.

204
00:16:30,976 --> 00:16:32,826
So for this one,
I'm going to plug these in.

205
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:45,690
Okay.

206
00:17:04,442 --> 00:17:07,563
Okay, so our case cables are now
secured to our motherboard.

207
00:17:07,563 --> 00:17:11,470
One good idea is sometimes your
motherboard will come with some guides.

208
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:16,360
This will help you fasten your cables
to your motherboard so it's clean and

209
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,540
tight on your case.

210
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,537
I'm just going to go ahead and
do that right here.

211
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,857
Now that we have our cables
securely fastened to our case,

212
00:17:27,857 --> 00:17:30,460
let's don't forget one more thing,
our graphics card.

213
00:17:32,255 --> 00:17:35,240
We'll need that so
that we can upload video to our monitor.

214
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,131
We're going to plug this graphics
card into our PCI-Express slot on our

215
00:17:38,131 --> 00:17:38,770
motherboard.

216
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:42,219
Just like the RAM,

217
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:45,100
you are going to put a little bit of
pressure when you insert this in.

218
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,343
So don't feel bad by putting
a little bit of pressure and

219
00:17:48,343 --> 00:17:50,213
you'll hear a click like this.

220
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:57,860
Once you've done it,
you can tightly secure it to your case.

221
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,110
This is going to vary from case to case.

222
00:18:03,368 --> 00:18:06,210
And there you go,
your graphics card has been installed.

223
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,080
All right, I think that's it.

224
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,140
Let's cover up our computer.

225
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:14,875
First make sure you take your
anti-static brace right away.

226
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:19,425
Get our case.

227
00:18:24,117 --> 00:18:29,425
Put that in like so, and
just plug, and that's it.

228
00:18:35,102 --> 00:18:38,280
There you go,
we finally built our machine.

229
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,240
Last but not least,
let's connect our monitor, keyboard, and

230
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,520
mouse to the desktop.

231
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,822
So first, let's get our keyboard.

232
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:48,749
What we're going to do is we're going to
connect this USB to the USB port on

233
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:49,363
our desktop.

234
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:55,540
Then we'll going to get our mouse,
do the same thing.

235
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,771
Connect this to our USB port.

236
00:19:01,853 --> 00:19:04,862
And then finally we're going to
go ahead and connect our monitor.

237
00:19:04,862 --> 00:19:08,890
For this monitor, we're going to go
ahead and use a display port cable.

238
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:16,030
I want to connect one end to our desktop,
like so.

239
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,851
Next, I want to plug this into my monitor.

240
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,410
All right,
this is the most interesting part.

241
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,810
Let's see if all this works.

242
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,480
So I'm going to power it on.

243
00:19:37,818 --> 00:19:39,501
I got a blue light, which is good.

244
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:42,490
And of course it's going to
vary from system to system.

245
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,530
Let's see if something
shows up on the monitor.

246
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:46,935
So computer is booting up.

247
00:19:49,896 --> 00:19:54,704
Let's see, okay it looks like the monitor
is receiving signal, which is good.

248
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:59,100
There we have messages, success,
there we go, it's working, perfect.

249
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,110
If you're having issues with your
computer not starting up, that's okay.

250
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,930
Check that your power supply can supply
the correct amount of wattage or

251
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,100
make sure your connectors
are in the right place.

252
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,165
What's this?

253
00:20:11,165 --> 00:20:15,785
Non-system disk or disk error,
replace and strike any key when ready.

254
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:20,250
It looks like our disk doesn't have an
operating system to boot into, no worries.

255
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,796
That's what we'll be discussing
in the next set of lessons.

256
00:20:22,796 --> 00:20:24,700
We'll learn what
an operating system is and

257
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,710
what the main operating systems are and
how to install one.

258
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,760
Well good job, you've got your
computer up and running and

259
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:33,820
the monitor is receiving signal,
so that's it.

260
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,090
Let's take a moment and
think about what you just did,

261
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,644
not only did you learn about each
component of a computer, but

262
00:20:39,644 --> 00:20:43,990
you figured out how they work individually
and then we built one together.

263
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,500
It's quite an accomplishment.

264
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,910
For your next assignment, we build
a widget that will let you assemble

265
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:52,280
a computer digitally, putting all
the different parts together or

266
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,860
if you have all the computer
parts already, you can assemble

267
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,410
one in real life and then write a short
review process of how you did it.

268
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,340
If you get stuck, don't worry, go back and

269
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,270
review the different videos
covering the various components.

270
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,780
I know you can do it.

271
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,110
I've had lots of fun teaching you
all about hardware and don't worry,

272
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,150
we'll meet again soon when you make
it to the system administration

273
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,510
IT infrastructure services course.

274
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:14,760
Next up, my good friend,

275
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,430
Cindy Quach, is going to introduce
you to operating systems.

276
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,970
Operating systems are absolutely essential
in IT considering that without them

277
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:26,760
none of this hardware we've discussed
would be able to accomplish anything.

278
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,670
Tell Cindy I said hi.
