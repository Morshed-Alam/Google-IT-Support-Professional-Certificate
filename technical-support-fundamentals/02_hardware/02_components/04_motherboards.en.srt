1
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,410
The motherboard, the foundation that holds our computer together.

2
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,165
It lets us expand our computer's functionality by adding expansion cards around

3
00:00:21,165 --> 00:00:23,535
its power from the power supply and it allows

4
00:00:23,535 --> 00:00:26,725
the different parts of the computer to communicate with each other.

5
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:29,570
In short, it's a total boss.

6
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:33,080
Every motherboard has a few key characteristics.

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,430
First is the chipset,

8
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,660
which decides how components talk to each other on our machine.

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,775
The chipset on motherboards is made up of two chips.

10
00:00:41,775 --> 00:00:47,380
One is called the Northbridge that interconnects stuff like RAM and video cards.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:53,615
The other chip is the Southbridge which maintains our IO or input/output controllers,

12
00:00:53,615 --> 00:00:58,235
like hard drives and USB devices that input and output data.

13
00:00:58,235 --> 00:01:01,940
In some modern CPUs, the Northbridge has been directly

14
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,180
integrated into the CPU so there isn't a separate Northbridge chipset.

15
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,040
A chipset is a key component of our motherboard that allows us

16
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,090
to manage data between our CPU, RAM, and peripherals.

17
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:18,485
Peripherals are the external devices we connect to our computer like: a mouse,

18
00:01:18,485 --> 00:01:20,660
keyboard, and a monitor.

19
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,810
You'll learn more about peripherals in an upcoming lesson.

20
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:25,365
In addition to the chipsets,

21
00:01:25,365 --> 00:01:30,410
motherboards have another key characteristic which allows the use of expansion slots.

22
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:35,780
Expansion slots also give us the ability to increase the functionality of our computer.

23
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,261
If you want to upgrade your graphics card,

24
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:39,110
you could purchase one and just install it on

25
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,435
your motherboard through the expansion slot.

26
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:43,715
The standard for an expansion slot today is

27
00:01:43,715 --> 00:01:48,875
the PCI Express or Peripheral Component Interconnect Express.

28
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,940
A PCIe bus looks like a slot on the motherboard and

29
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,605
a PCIe base expansion card looks like a smaller circuit board.

30
00:01:57,605 --> 00:02:01,790
The last component of motherboards that we'll discuss is form factor.

31
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,970
There are different size of motherboards that are available today.

32
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:08,010
These sizes of form factors determine the amount

33
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,280
of stuff we can put in it and the amount of space we'll have.

34
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,890
The most common form factor for motherboards is

35
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,775
ATX which stands for Advanced Technology eXtended.

36
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:20,700
ATX actually comes in different sizes too.

37
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,063
In desktops, you'll commonly see full sized ATX's.

38
00:02:24,063 --> 00:02:27,225
If you don't want to use an ATX form factor,

39
00:02:27,225 --> 00:02:32,970
you could use an ITX or Information Technology eXtended form factor.

40
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,490
These are much smaller than ATX boards.

41
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,280
For example, the Intel NUC uses a variation of

42
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,235
the ITX board which comes in three board sizes;

43
00:02:41,235 --> 00:02:45,720
mini-ITX, nano-ITX, and pico-ITX.

44
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,120
When building your computer,

45
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,345
you will need to keep in mind what type of form factor you want.

46
00:02:50,345 --> 00:02:53,310
Do you want to build something small that can't handle as much workload?

47
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,620
Or, do you want a powerhouse workstation that you can add lots of functionality to?

48
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,530
The form factor will also play a role into what expansion slots you might want to use.

49
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,534
Understanding motherboards and their characteristics

50
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:08,970
can be a big plus when fixing hardware issues,

51
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,490
since things like the type of RAM module or

52
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,865
processor socket are dependent on the kind of motherboard they need to fit into.

53
00:03:15,865 --> 00:03:19,605
Let's say you're responding to a ticket for a user who is having video problems,

54
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:21,480
you don't want to make it all the way to

55
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,467
their desk only to realize the graphics card due board as

56
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:27,555
a replacement doesn't fit the motherboard their computer uses.

57
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:29,760
You'll learn more about customer service and

58
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,555
troubleshooting tactics later on in this course.

59
00:03:32,555 --> 00:03:35,250
But for now, make sure that your motherboard can

60
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,000
fit any replacement or upgrade that you want to implement.
