<h2>I. Purpose/Overview</h2>
    
<p>The purpose of this document is to demystify the role that the processor plays in popular consumer electronics, especially laptops and desktop computing systems. Further, this document offers a breakdown of the current state of the processor market—particularly, highlighting the companies, Intel and AMD and how their current product lines size up against each other. Though the emphasis of this document is desktop computing, the spike in  relavance of the smartphone and tablet makes mention of mobile processors useful, hence, ARM—a leader in mobile processing is profiled as well. Also provided is a chart that classfies these processors for the purposes of helping you decide on a system appropriate for your needs. Finally, we provide a section dedicated to demystifying some of the technical/marketing jargon that is tossed around as companies introduce new product lines. </p>

    <a name="why"></a>
<h2>II. Why Does The Processor Matter</h2>
    
<p>The microprocessor—or commonly, the CPU or just processor—is the brain of a computer. It performs many calculations behind the scenes, ultimately allowing you to complete tasks as trivial as composing an e-mail to tasks as intensive as data analysis and modeling. Processors are encountered in many forms of consumer electronics. Most familar to many are  notebook and desktop computers as well as mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Though the processor is just one of the many physical components that comprise these products, it is arguably the most central to determining their overall "usefulness" into the future as software requirements become increasingly demanding.</p>
<p>Unlike other components of a notebook computer, the processor is a fixed component. This is in contrast to RAM and hard disk storage which can be upgraded in many cases. Therefore, another consideration is the fact that the CPU you choose will be the same throughout the life of the system. This implies that as applications and operating systems become more sophisticated, the computer's ability to handle them will be directly affected by the purchase decision made all that time ago. This choice may mean the difference between a system that is useful for another year or two versus one that is not. A final consideration in choosing a CPU is the suggested or minimum requirements of the important software to be used as well as any academic department recommendations as a guide as to the relative kind of computing performance expected for a particular field of study.</p>

<h2>III. Companies</h2>
    
    
<h3>i.</h3>
   <a name="intel"></a> <img src="/images/group7/4927/intel_2012.jpg" alt="Intel">
    
<p>If there was a single semiconductor chip maker the average consumer is aware of it would likely be Intel. If not for the famous Intel "chime" as heard in many television commercials throughout the years then definitely for the fact that it would be difficult not to encounter its technologies in some form whether at work, school or otherwise. Intel is the premier chip maker for personal computers—companies such as Apple, Dell, HP, Samsung, Sony have product lines that depend on the processors that Intel produces. Intel's processors generally offer the best performance for all-around usage. This has been especially the case the last several years with the introduction and evolution of Intel's Core series product line. Currently, Intel's flagship consumer product line consists of mobile and desktop-grade Core i3, Core i5 and Core i7 processors now in their second generation (dubbed "Sandy Bridge").  The third and latest generation of these processors (dubbed "Ivy Bridge") began to roll out for release late April 2012. The biggest difference between these two generations amounts to a moderate improvement in all-around computing performance but a substantial improvement in integrated graphics performance. Another significant feature Ivy Bridge adds is native USB 3.0 support, overtaking USB 2.0.</p>
    
    
<h3>ii.</h3>
   <a name="amd"></a> <img src="/images/group7/4927/amd_2012.jpg" alt="AMD">
    
<p>Though not considered the behemoth in the personal computing space as Intel, AMD is a decisive runner-up—and arguably the only true competitor Intel has in this domain. After spending much of the early to middle 2000's as being the performance and value leader with their Athlon 64 line of personal computing processors, AMD—unable to mimic this success in more recent years, has shifted their focus towards both enthusiast and budget-oriented system configurations. As a result, AMD is considered to be a viable alternative to Intel.  Their current offerings are flanked by the Phenom series processors and Fusion APU processors. The Fusion APU (AMD A-Series) is a relatively new platform (as of 2011 and ongoing) that attempts to merge high-end graphical capabilities on the same chip as the processor. This means if your work or play requires a powerful graphics card, then AMD can potentially offer a cost effective alternative.</p>
    
    
<h3>iii.</h3>
    <a name="arm"></a><img src="/images/group7/4927/arm_2012.jpg" alt="ARM">
    
<p> The increased need for mobile productivity and entertainment has given rise to a relatively new class of devices: smartphones and tablets. ARM is well-known for the design of mobile, power-efficient processor designs. In recent years it has seen its technology used in the products of many prominent electronics companies.  Apple's A4/A5/A5X, Nvidia's Tegra, Samsung's Exynos and Texas Instruments' OMAP products all integrate ARM processors into what is known as a system-on-a-chip (SoC).  SoCs merge many of the essential components of a computer  (such as the CPU, RAM, ROM etc.) on a single chip which allows devices that utilize them to be lightweight and compact. These SoCs have gone on to be implemented in blockbuster products such as Apple's iPhone and iPad or Samsung's series of Galaxy phones. ARM's presence as the CPU and architecture of choice on many mobile devices cannot be understated as estimates put their numbers in the billions. </p>

<h2>IV. Processor Comparison Table</h2>
    
<p>This section offers a breakdown and comparison of the different product lines within Intel's/AMD's offerings. The processors are divided by the companies making the processors (Intel and AMD) then within those companies, a general ranking and purpose is offered for the kinds of processors each is offering. That is, some will be far better suited for doing advanced tasks such as data/statistical analysis, modelling, and mulltimedia creation where at the other extreme (toward the bottom of the Intel and AMD charts below), these products will not be able to handle much more than web browsing and e-mail. In between those extremes are processors that can usually handle a little bit from the top and bottom ends of the spectrum. The kind of performance implied by these processors is typically enough and recommended for most users; e.g. the Core i3 or i5 processors on the Intel side or the Phenom II or A-series from AMD's offerings.  </p>

<h2>V. Benchmarks</h2>
<p>It is important to note that there are a considerable amount of details that factor into the overall performance of any given  processor beyond frequency (GHz). This is not a valid way to compare most processors, especially between competing companies and between generations. For example, an Intel Pentium 4 (a processor that is generations behind any current Intel i-series processor) running at 3.8 GHz is much slower compared than any i3, i5 or i7 running at lower GHz—the biggest reason for this is the improvement in architecture allowing for increases in the number of cores as well as improvements in other features (such as cache memory and bus technology) that allow the modern CPU to get more work done in a given clock cycle.  Hence, it is more useful to compare frequencies and number of cores of processors across the same product line.</p>
<p>CPU benchmarking involves running a specific software tool or suite of tools which  allow users to 'distill' an overall performance rating that can be used to rank against other processors. Computer hardware websites such as those listed below have aggregated rankings for all major desktop/notebook processors released within the last decade, allowing a prospective buyer to get a feel for the relative level of performance separating one processor from another. Further, these benchmarks when considered in tandem with the cost of a given processor also allow buyers  to compare value as far as amount of performance per dollar.  This is important since CPU performance does not necessarily correlate with price, especially across different makers.</p>
<p>The following links below provide comprehensive rankings for desktop and mobile processors. </p>

<h2>VII. FAQ</h2>
<h4>Q: What is the difference between a 32-bit and 64-bit processor?</h4>
<p>A :  From a practical standpoint, the true difference at hand is the ability to run a 32-bit operating system (OS) versus a 64-bit OS and their subsequent applications. Technically, 64-bit allows the processor to address larger chunks of data from physical memory (RAM) than their 32-bit counterparts. Hence, while the maximum amount of RAM for a 32-bit system is 4GB, for a 64-bit system there is no practical limit except where artificially imposed by a specific version of an OS or system manufacturer—for example, Windows 7 Home Edition allows for up to 16GB of RAM where Professional and Ultimate allows up to 192GB. The benefit of 64-bit arises in dealing with the increasing sophistication of applications as well as working with and processing large files with greater efficiency. Most modern CPUs  such as any of Intel's iX series are 64-bit and virtually any new configuration of a machine with these processors include a 64-bit  OS.  It is important to note that while 64-bit CPUs can typically run 32-bit applications, the reverse is not true. </p>
<h4>Q: What is the relationship between a processor and RAM? Why and when can a RAM upgrade make my system run faster?</h4>
<p>A : Where the CPU acts as the brains of a computer, processing your input into output, Random Access Memory (RAM) can be considered an analogue to working memory. It is a fast type of volatile memory that the system uses to help process data. When the amount of RAM is overwhelmed by various processes on the system—which can happen if a user had begun using a more sophisticated OS with only the minimum amount of recommended RAM or if many applications are running at once—The os is forced into using the same ram for multiple purposes, swapping data in and out of ram from the hard drive, which slows the system down. Swapping data from the storage device will result in slower performance The CPU may be fast but it can process data only as quickly as the RAM can dispense it. In essence, a lack of sufficient RAM can lead to a system being 'bottlenecked'. Upgrading RAM can help ensure that the system is running on as little if any virtual memory as possible, this makes the machine more responsive especially when multi-tasking across several applications. Hence,  the value of RAM is in its ability to ensure that the CPU is able to pull data as seamlessly as possible. If the current amount of RAM in a system is 'enough', adding more RAM will not serve to speed up the system any further. At this point, the system runs as fast as the CPU is capable of and depending on the needs of the user, a processor upgrade might be considered.</p>
