1
00:00:12,068 --> 00:00:15,770
So, before we get into computer storage,
we need to fill in some gaps.

2
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,460
I'm referring to things like gigabytes,
bits, etc.

3
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,070
But we actually haven't talked at
all about what those metrics mean.

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,050
Sorry, I kind of get
a bit ahead of myself.

5
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:29,580
As you might have guessed,
these terms refer to data sizes.

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,840
The smallest unit of
a data storage is a bit.

7
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,410
A bit can store one binary digit,
so it can store a one or zero.

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,840
The next largest unit of storage is called
a byte, which is comprised of 8 bits.

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,330
A single byte can hold a letter,
number or symbol.

10
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,650
The next largest unit is
refer to as kibibyte, but

11
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,110
we typically use the term kilobyte.

12
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,329
A kilobyte is made up of 1,024 bytes.

13
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,114
If you're curious why 1 kilobyte refers
to as 1,024 bytes and not 1,000 bytes,

14
00:01:02,114 --> 00:01:05,425
you can read more about that in
the next supplemental reading.

15
00:01:05,425 --> 00:01:07,936
For now,
here's a quick data conversion chart.

16
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,305
How much does 500 gigabytes even mean?

17
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:15,630
Let's take a look at the size
of an average music file,

18
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,950
which is about three megabytes.

19
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:23,010
On a 500 gigabyte machine,
that's approximately 165,000 music files.

20
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,650
That's a lot of music.

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,114
We store all of our computer's
data on our hard drive,

22
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:32,272
which allows us to store our programs,
music, pictures, etc.

23
00:01:32,272 --> 00:01:34,495
Have you ever had an issue
with your computer and

24
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:37,070
lost all the data that
was on your hard drive?

25
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,270
Yeah, me too, it was the worst.

26
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,860
This actually happens a lot and

27
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,910
you'll probably encounter it
as an IT support specialist.

28
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,910
Make sure you backup your data to be safe.

29
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,330
This means you should copy or
save your data somewhere else,

30
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,350
just in case something goes wrong and
your hard drive crashes.

31
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,660
That way, you won't lose all your data.

32
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,740
There are two basic hard
drive types used today.

33
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,790
Hard disk drives, or HDDs,
use a spinning platter and

34
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:04,760
a mechanical arm to read and
write information.

35
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,660
The speed that the platter rotate allows
you to read and write data faster.

36
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:15,140
This is commonly referred to as RPM,
or revolution per minute.

37
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,210
A hard drive with a higher RPM is faster,
so if you go out and buy a hard

38
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,625
drive today, you might see something
like a 500 gigabyte with 5400 RPM.

39
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:29,210
HDDs are prone to a lot more damage
because there are a lot of moving parts.

40
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:33,740
This susceptibility to damage went
away with a new type of storage called

41
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,290
solid state drive, or SSD.

42
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,530
SSDs have no moving parts.

43
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,680
Are you familiar with a USB stick?

44
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,950
SSDs are created in a similar way.

45
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,120
The information is stored on microchips
and data travels a lot faster than HDDs.

46
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,840
The form factor for SSDs is also
slimmer compared to their HDD cousins.

47
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,170
Sounds great, doesn't it?

48
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,470
So why doesn't everyone use SSDs?

49
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,940
Well, both have their pros and cons.

50
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,350
HDDs are more affordable, but
they're more prone to damage.

51
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,300
SSDs are less risky when it
comes to losing data, but

52
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,580
they're also more expensive.

53
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,990
So you may not buy as much memory storage
in SSDs than what you can get in HDDs.

54
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,610
Believe it or not, there are even
hybrid SSD and HDD drives out there.

55
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,730
They offer SSD performance
where you need it.

56
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,690
For things like system performance,
such as booting your computer,

57
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:29,990
along with hard disk drives for less
important stuff, like basic file storage.

58
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,580
There are a few interfaces that hard
drives use to connect to our system.

59
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,810
ATA interfaces are the most common ones.

60
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,050
The most popular ATA
drive is a serial ATA,

61
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,755
or SATA, which uses one cable for
data transfers.

62
00:03:44,755 --> 00:03:46,405
SATA drives are hot swappable.

63
00:03:46,405 --> 00:03:47,675
Great term, don't you think?

64
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:51,155
It means you don't have to turn off
your machine to plug in a SATA drive.

65
00:03:51,155 --> 00:03:55,032
SATA drives move data faster and
use a more efficient cable, like this one,

66
00:03:55,032 --> 00:03:56,755
than it's predecessors.

67
00:03:56,755 --> 00:04:00,460
SATA has been the de facto interface for
HDDs today.

68
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,740
But people quickly found that using
a SATA cable wasn't good enough for

69
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,600
some of the blazing fast SSDs
that were coming on the market.

70
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,250
The interface couldn't keep up
with speed of the newest SSDs.

71
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,650
So another interface standard was
created called NVM Express, or NVMe.

72
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,340
Instead of using a cable to connect
your drive to your machine,

73
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,380
the drive was added as an expansion slot,
which allows for

74
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,740
greater throughput of data and
increased efficiency.
