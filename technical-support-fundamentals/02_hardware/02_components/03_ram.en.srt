00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:15,035
Let's talk about RAM, our computers' short term memory.

2
00:00:15,035 --> 00:00:18,625
We use RAM to store data that we want to access quickly.

3
00:00:18,625 --> 00:00:22,400
This data changes all the time so it isn't permanent.

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,275
Almost all RAM is volatile,

5
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:26,480
which means that once we power off our machines,

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,805
the data stored in RAM is cleared.

7
00:00:28,805 --> 00:00:32,690
Remember that our computer is comprised of programs.

8
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,956
To run a program,

9
00:00:33,956 --> 00:00:38,740
we need to make a copy of it in RAM so our CPU can process it.

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,495
When you see a new phone or laptop that's says it has 16 gigs of RAM,

11
00:00:42,495 --> 00:00:45,755
that means it can run up to 16 gigs of programs,

12
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:48,825
meaning you can run lots of programs at the same time.

13
00:00:48,825 --> 00:00:51,610
When you type in a document, you're using RAM.

14
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:53,960
If you've ever had the misfortune of working on

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,133
an important presentation of paper and losing power,

16
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:00,890
you know the feeling you get when all of the work you've done is lost.

17
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,600
It's a total bummer. This happens to anything with RAM, even video games.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,435
Have you ever gone on a long campaign without saving,

19
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:10,535
then right as you get to a safe point,

20
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:15,370
the power goes off on the console and all the progress you've made is lost forever?

21
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:18,950
It's not fun at all. You spend the next hour or so deciding whether or

22
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,820
not just to rage quit the game completely and start all over from scratch.

23
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,705
Not that this happened to me or anything,

24
00:01:24,705 --> 00:01:26,260
that was just a friend.

25
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:30,225
Anyway, all of this happens because frankly as it's data when powered off.

26
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:31,800
There are lots of types of RAM.

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,800
And the one is commonly found in computers,

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,265
is DRAM or dynamic random access memory.

29
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:39,870
Where no one or zero is sent to DRAM,

30
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:43,350
it source each bit in a microscopic capacitor.

31
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,785
This is either the charge or discharge represented by one or zero.

32
00:01:47,785 --> 00:01:52,705
These semiconductors are put into chips that are on the RAM and store our data.

33
00:01:52,705 --> 00:01:56,385
There are also different types of memory states that DRAM chips can be put on.

34
00:01:56,385 --> 00:01:58,261
The more modern DIMM sticks,

35
00:01:58,261 --> 00:02:01,760
which usually stands for Dual Inline Memory Module,

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,350
have different sizes of pins on them.

37
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,445
I should call out, we don't really buy RAM based on the number of DRAM chips they have.

38
00:02:09,445 --> 00:02:11,830
They are labeled by the capacity of RAM on a stake,

39
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,780
like an 8 gig stick of RAM.

40
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,330
After DRAM was created,

41
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:21,150
RAM manufacturers build something called SDRAM which stands for Synchronous DRAM.

42
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,860
This type of RAM is synchronized to

43
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,025
our systems' clock speed allowing quicker processing of data.

44
00:02:26,025 --> 00:02:28,714
In today's system, we use another type of RAM,

45
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:30,960
called double data rate SDRAM,

46
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,025
or DDR SDRAM for short.

47
00:02:35,025 --> 00:02:39,650
Most people refer to this RAM as DDR, even shorter.

48
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:43,170
There were lots of iterations of DDR, from DDR1,

49
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,130
DDR2, DDR3 and now, DDR4.

50
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,530
DDR is faster, takes up less power,

51
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,950
and has a larger capacity than earlier SDRAM versions.

52
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,990
The latest version, DDR4,

53
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,250
is the fastest type of short term memory currently available for your computer.

54
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,410
And faster RAM means that programs can be run

55
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:04,585
faster and that more programs can run at the same time.

56
00:03:04,585 --> 00:03:06,990
Keep in mind that any RAM sticks you use

57
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,660
need a compatible motherboard with a different number of

58
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,920
pins aligned with the motherboard RAM slots.

59
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,270
Just like with the CPU,

60
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:24,560
make sure that your motherboard is compatible with any RAM sticks that you buy.

61
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,000
Up next, we'll take a deep dive into motherboards.
