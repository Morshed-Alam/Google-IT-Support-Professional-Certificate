00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:15,050
So, let's take a look at the back of our computer again.

2
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:18,050
Here, you'll see lots of connectors or ports.

3
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,725
We can plug in different objects like a mouse,

4
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:24,730
keyboard, and a monitor.

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,475
These are known as peripherals.

6
00:00:27,475 --> 00:00:30,190
A peripheral is basically anything that you connect

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,245
to your computer externally that adds functionality.

8
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:35,650
You probably used USB devices before.

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,540
USB, also known as

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,790
Universal Serial Bus devices are the most popular connections for our gadgets.

11
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,765
USB has gone through lots of changes since inception.

12
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:49,430
You most commonly encounter USB 2.0,

13
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,690
USB 3.0, and 3.1 in today's system.

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,605
Here's a quick rundown of the different versions.

15
00:00:55,605 --> 00:01:00,610
USB 2.0 transfers speeds of 480 megabytes per second,

16
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:05,225
USB 3.0 transfers speeds of five gigabytes per second,

17
00:01:05,225 --> 00:01:10,155
USB 3.1 transfers speeds of 10 gigabytes per second.

18
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:13,890
In the chart, let's pay attention to the details.

19
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,390
Using capital M lowercase b forward slash s instead

20
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,250
of using capital M capital B to reference transfer speed.

21
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,350
These are actually different units.

22
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,226
MB is megabyte or unit of data storage,

23
00:01:30,226 --> 00:01:36,270
while capital M lower case b forward slash s is a megabit per second,

24
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,140
which is a unit of data transfer rate.

25
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,305
People often mistake speeds of 40 megabit per second

26
00:01:43,305 --> 00:01:47,825
to mean that you can transfer 40 megabytes of data per second.

27
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:51,575
Remember, that one byte is 8 bits,

28
00:01:51,575 --> 00:01:54,300
so to transfer a one megabyte file in a

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,265
second you need an 8 megabits per second connection speed.

30
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:03,730
So, to transfer 40 megabytes of data in a second,

31
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:08,645
you need a transfer speed of 240 megabits per second.

32
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:12,780
You'll also need comparable USB ports to go with your devices.

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,740
If you connect a USB 2.0 device into a USB 3.0 port,

34
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,185
you won't get 3.0 transfer speeds.

35
00:02:20,185 --> 00:02:23,774
But you can still use the port since it's backward compatible,

36
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:27,115
meaning older hardware work with newer hardware.

37
00:02:27,115 --> 00:02:29,960
The ports are easy to differentiate. Let me show you.

38
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:38,055
In general, USB 2.0 are black and USB 3.0 are blue and 3.1 ports are teal.

39
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:42,075
This may change depending on manufacturers.

40
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:44,405
There are lots of types of USB connectors,

41
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:48,555
and you can read about all of them in the supplemental reading right after this video.

42
00:02:48,555 --> 00:02:51,405
Check it out. Back to USB connectors.

43
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:52,730
The most recent one is

44
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,165
the type C connector which is meant to replace many peripheral connections.

45
00:02:58,165 --> 00:03:03,115
It's quickly becoming a universal standard for display and data transfer.

46
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:04,875
In addition to USB peripherals,

47
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:07,870
you should also be aware of display peripherals.

48
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,270
There are some common inputs standards to know.

49
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,810
Most computer monitors will have one or more of these connections,

50
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,255
but you might encounter some older standards too.

51
00:03:16,255 --> 00:03:20,565
DVI. DVI cables generally just output video.

52
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:22,980
If you need to hook up a monitor or projector for

53
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,990
a slide presentation and you want audio too, you may be out of luck.

54
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,610
Instead, you want to look at one of the following cables.

55
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,230
HDMI. This has become a standard in lots of televisions

56
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,660
and computers nowadays and outputs both video and audio.

57
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,580
Another standard that's become popular among manufacturers is

58
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,930
a displayPort which also outputs audio and video.

59
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,525
In addition to audio and video,

60
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:51,785
USB type C can also do data transfer and power.

61
00:03:51,785 --> 00:03:54,185
As an IT support specialist,

62
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:58,800
you'll work with peripherals like USB devices and display devices a lot.

63
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,505
Now, you'll be able to distinguish between the major types.

64
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:02,880
In the next lesson,

65
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,860
we're going to learn how our computer initializes all of the hardware we talked about.
