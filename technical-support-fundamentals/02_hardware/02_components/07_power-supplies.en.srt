1
00:00:11,539 --> 00:00:14,554
In order to get our computer to work,
let's give it some power.

2
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:18,217
Computers have a power supply that
converts electricity from your volt to

3
00:00:18,217 --> 00:00:19,320
something usable.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,670
There are two types of electricity, DC,
or direct current, which flows in one

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:29,300
direction and AC, or alternating current,
which changes directions constantly.

6
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,130
Our computers use DC voltage, so we have
to have a way to convert the AC voltage

7
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,590
from our power company
to something we can use.

8
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:39,330
That's what our power supply does.

9
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,880
It converts the AC we get from
the wall into low voltage DC

10
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,130
power that we can use and
transmit throughout our computer.

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:47,290
So let's talk about power supplies.

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,354
I actually have one right here.

13
00:00:48,354 --> 00:00:50,293
Let me show you how one looks like.

14
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:52,050
Let me take it out right here.

15
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,400
So most power supply units have a fan,
which is right in here.

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,577
They also has voltage information
just normally listed underneath or

17
00:01:02,577 --> 00:01:07,751
on the side, and cables, like this one,
to power your motherboard,

18
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:13,070
and, A power cable.

19
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,590
Have you ever plugged one of your
devices into the wall outlet and

20
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,520
fried your device?

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,500
If you haven't, you're really lucky.

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,390
After completing this lesson, hopefully
you will know how to avoid that situation.

23
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,840
To understand electricity,
we must use the example of water pipes.

24
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,340
Our sinks have a faucet that's
connected to a pressurized water tank.

25
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,030
When we turn on the faucet,
water comes out.

26
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:37,060
This is sort of like
how electricity works.

27
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,400
When we plug an appliance
into a wall outlet and

28
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,330
turn it on,
a flow of electricity comes out.

29
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,820
If we added more pressure to our water
tank, would more water come out of it?

30
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,390
The higher the pressure,
the more water there will be.

31
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:54,430
When it comes to electricity,
we refer to the pressure as voltage.

32
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:59,323
So when I was on vacation, to my surprise,
when I plugged in that 120 volt appliance

33
00:01:59,323 --> 00:02:04,760
into a 220 volt outlet, the power came
busting through and fried my charger.

34
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,830
If it was the other way around,
and a 220 volt appliance

35
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:12,475
was plugged into a 120 volt outlet,
I wouldn't have seen the same outcome.

36
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:15,700
I'll still be able to get electricity,
but slowly.

37
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,292
This would be similar to if a water
tank whose only half pressurized,

38
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:21,660
it will drew water, but slowly.

39
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,580
In some cases though, this can deteriorate
the performance of the device and

40
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,860
cause damage in the long term.

41
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,770
As a general rule, be sure to use
the proper voltage for your electronics.

42
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,210
We refer to the amount of electricity
coming out as current or amperage, and

43
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,950
it's measured in amps.

44
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,390
We can think of amps as
pulling electricity,

45
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,310
as opposed to voltage,
which pushes electricity.

46
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:49,080
Amps will pull as much electricity needed,
but voltage will just give you everything.

47
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,818
Look on the back of the one of your device
charges, you might see something like 1 or

48
00:02:53,818 --> 00:02:54,780
2.1a.

49
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,600
Charging a device with 2.1 amps will
actually charge a device faster because

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:04,580
it's able to put current from
a 2.1 amp than a 1 amp charger.

51
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:08,430
Finally, the other important part of
the electricity that you will need to know

52
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,340
is the wattage.

53
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,490
Wattage is the amount of volts and
amps that a device needs.

54
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,230
If your power supply has
too low of a wattage,

55
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,230
you won't be able to power your computer,
so make sure you have enough.

56
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,680
This doesn't mean that if you
have a large power supply,

57
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,140
you'll overpower your computer.

58
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,940
Power supplies just give you
the amount that your system needs.

59
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,790
It's best to error on the side
of large power supplies.

60
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,590
You can power most basic desktops
with a 500 watt power supply, but

61
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,900
if you're doing something more
demanding on your computer,

62
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,470
like playing a high-resolution video game
or doing a lot of video production and

63
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,830
rendering, you'll likely need a bigger
power supply for your computer.

64
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,850
On the other hand, if all you're
doing is just browsing the Web,

65
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,730
the power supply that comes with
your computer should be fine.

66
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,080
All kinds of issues are caused
by a bad power supply.

67
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,000
Sometimes the computer
doesn't even turn on at all.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,400
Since power supplies can fail for lots
of reasons like burnouts, power surges,

69
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,750
or even lightning strikes, knowing how to
diagnose power issues and replace a failed

70
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:11,000
power supply is a skill every IT support
specialist should have in their toolbox.
