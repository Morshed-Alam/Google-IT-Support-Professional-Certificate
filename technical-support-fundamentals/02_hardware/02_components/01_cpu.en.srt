1
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:18,455
If someone asked you, calculate the square root of 5,439,493,

2
00:00:18,455 --> 00:00:20,315
would you do the math by hand?

3
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:23,300
Unless you really love tedious Math problems,

4
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,620
you'd probably use a calculator.

5
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,505
What about binary?

6
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:30,805
Well, you probably wouldn't calculate binary by hand either.

7
00:00:30,805 --> 00:00:33,335
There's actually a very powerful calculator right

8
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:36,890
inside of your computer that processes binary for us.

9
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,580
We've already discussed this calculator in detail. Do you know what it is?

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,665
It's our CPU, the brain of our computer.

11
00:00:43,665 --> 00:00:49,675
In this video, we'll cover the more practical aspects of the CPU.

12
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:52,860
Remember that transition book that I talked about in an earlier lesson?

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,810
The CPU uses this to translate and perform functions on our data.

14
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,520
This transition book is called an instruction set,

15
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:05,175
which is literally just a list of instructions that our CPU is able to run.

16
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:07,865
Functions like adding, subtracting,

17
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:11,900
copying data are all instructions that our CPU can carry out.

18
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,470
Every single program on your computer, while extremely complex,

19
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,630
is broken down into very small and simple instructions found in our instruction set.

20
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,365
Instruction sets are hard-coded into our CPU.

21
00:01:24,365 --> 00:01:28,190
So different CPU manufacturers may use different instructions sets.

22
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,890
But they generally perform the same functions.

23
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,140
It's like how car manufacturers build their engines

24
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,215
differently but they all get the same job done.

25
00:01:36,215 --> 00:01:38,300
You probably work with computer hardware as an I.T.

26
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,420
support specialist, replacing failed hard disks,

27
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,770
upgrading RAM modules, and installing video cards.

28
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,770
So you need to be aware of what's out there.

29
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,900
You've probably heard of a few popular CPU manufacturers or

30
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,085
chipsets like Intel, AMD and Qualcomm.

31
00:01:55,085 --> 00:02:00,275
These CPU manufacturers use different part names to differentiate their processors.

32
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:03,710
Like Intel Core i7, AMD Athlon,

33
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,970
Snapdragon 810, Apple A8, and more.

34
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,335
Now, when you hear these terms,

35
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:11,075
you'll know what they mean.

36
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:14,380
Each of these CPU manufacturers have their strengths and weaknesses.

37
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,680
If you're interested in learning more about why some CPUs are more popular than others,

38
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,990
you can check out the next supplemental reading.

39
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,245
When you select your CPU,

40
00:02:23,245 --> 00:02:26,170
you need to make sure it's compatible with your motherboard.

41
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,440
The circuit board that connects all your components together. Heads up.

42
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,645
You can just buy a bunch of parts and expect them to work together.

43
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:37,550
There are different ways CPUs fit on motherboards using different sockets.

44
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,588
Your CPU might have lots of tiny pins that either

45
00:02:40,588 --> 00:02:44,095
stick out or have contact points that look like dots.

46
00:02:44,095 --> 00:02:45,425
Depending on your motherboard,

47
00:02:45,425 --> 00:02:48,950
you need to make sure these CPUs fit correctly in the socket.

48
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,560
There are currently two major types of CPU sockets,

49
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,140
Land Grid Array also known as LGA,

50
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,670
and Pin Grid Array,

51
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,475
also known as PGA.

52
00:02:57,475 --> 00:02:59,340
In an LGA socket,

53
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,260
like this one, there are pins that stick out of the motherboard.

54
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,030
The socket size may vary.

55
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,415
So always make sure you CPU and socket are compatible before hand.

56
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:11,675
When you purchase the CPU or motherboard,

57
00:03:11,675 --> 00:03:15,150
they will tell you right on the box what type of socket it has.

58
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,170
Make sure your CPU and motherboard socket also both match.

59
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,730
If it's not listed on the box,

60
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,465
you can go to the manufacturer's website where it usually

61
00:03:23,465 --> 00:03:27,320
list what types of CPUs are compatible with the motherboard.

62
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,390
The other type of socket is the PGA socket,

63
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,570
where the pins are located on the processor itself.

64
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,175
When we install our CPU,

65
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:38,670
we need to do a few things to it to keep it cool.

66
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,575
Since it does a lot of work,

67
00:03:40,575 --> 00:03:42,420
it's prone to overheating.

68
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,075
We have to make sure to include a heat sink, too,

69
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:52,555
which takes the heat from our CPU and dissipates it through a fan or another medium.

70
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:55,840
There's one last thing I want to call out about CPUs.

71
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,625
If you purchase a CPU, you'll see that it has either a 32 bit or 64 bit architecture.

72
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:06,760
What does that mean? Well, we know we can't process 8 bits in binary.

73
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,060
Now, imagine how we can process with 32 or even 64 bits.

74
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,400
CPUs that have 32 bit or

75
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:19,275
64 bit architecture are just specifying how much data it can efficiently handle.

76
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:21,230
You can read more about the differences between

77
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,140
32 bit and 64 bit architecture in the next reading.

78
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,110
For now, the main takeaway is that

79
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,610
the CPU is one of the most important parts of a computer.

80
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,660
So we have to make sure it's compatible with

81
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,000
all other components and can perform well for our computing needs.
