00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,500
We talked briefly about the networking protocols our devices use

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,100
to help our packets get from one destination to another destination,

3
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,270
but what are they?

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,360
There are lots and lots of network protocols used and they're all

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,565
necessary to help us get our packets in the right place.

6
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:31,826
Think of network protocols like a set of rules for how we transfer data in a network.

7
00:00:31,826 --> 00:00:35,640
Imagine if you sent a letter to your friend Sasha who lives in California,

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,965
but your post office sends it out to another Sasha who lives out in New York.

9
00:00:39,965 --> 00:00:41,405
That would hopefully never happen,

10
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:44,025
since the post office has rules that they follow

11
00:00:44,025 --> 00:00:46,746
to make sure your letter is sent to the correct address.

12
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:49,160
Our networking protocols do the same thing.

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,075
There are rules that make sure our packets are routed efficiently,

14
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:55,785
aren't corrupted, are secure,

15
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:58,775
go to the right machine and are named appropriately.

16
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:02,612
You get the idea. We'll cover specific network protocols later on,

17
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:05,700
but there are two protocols that you need to know.

18
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,305
The Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol,

19
00:01:09,305 --> 00:01:11,420
or TCP/IP for short,

20
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,500
which have become the predominant protocols of the Internet.

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,805
The Internet Protocol or IP,

22
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:20,250
is responsible for delivering our packets to the right computers.

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,170
Remember those addresses that computers use to find something on a network?

24
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,100
They're called IP addresses or Internet protocol addresses.

25
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,240
The Internet Protocol helps us route information.

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,015
The Transmission Control Protocol or TCP,

27
00:01:35,015 --> 00:01:40,940
is a protocol that handles reliable delivery of information from one network to another.

28
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,060
This protocol was an important part of the creation of

29
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,050
the internet since it let us share information with other computers.

30
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,866
We'll spend a lot of time diving into these protocols in the next course,

31
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:55,205
the bits and bytes of computer networking, so stay tuned.

32
00:01:55,205 --> 00:02:01,000
For now, you've got a high level understanding of how the internet works with TCP/IP.
