00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,958
There are lots of different ways to
use the Internet, we all know that.

2
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:19,644
But I want to cover one of the more
prevalent ways that people access

3
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,290
the Internet, through the Web.

4
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:25,820
All websites can be
accessed through the Web.

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,250
Websites are basically text
documents that we format with HTML,

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,620
or hypertext markup language.

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,690
It's a coding language
used by web browsers.

8
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,730
Web pages are generally made
up of very basic components.

9
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:45,060
They contain multimedia content like text,
images, audio and video.

10
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:48,498
When you want to navigate to a website,

11
00:00:48,498 --> 00:00:52,805
you would type in a URL
like www.reddit.com.

12
00:00:52,805 --> 00:00:56,476
A URL, which stands for
Uniform Resource Locator,

13
00:00:56,476 --> 00:01:00,170
is just a web address
similar to a home address.

14
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,680
Notice the www in the URL?

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,040
It stands for World Wide Web.

16
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,080
The second portion, reddit.com,
is something we call a domain name.

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,010
Anyone can register a domain name.

18
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,320
It's just our website name.

19
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,490
Once a name is taken, it'll be registered
to ICANN, the Internet Corporation for

20
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,390
Assigned Names and Numbers.

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,040
Once a domain name is
registered with ICANN,

22
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,960
no one else can take that name
unless it becomes available again.

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,740
The last part of the URL
in this case is .com.

24
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,215
But you can also use different domain
endings like reddit.net or reddit.org.

25
00:01:37,215 --> 00:01:39,875
The different domain name
endings are standards for

26
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:41,735
what type of website it might be.

27
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:47,395
So a domain that ends in .edu is mainly
used for educational institutions.

28
00:01:47,395 --> 00:01:51,015
Remember how computers use IP
addresses to find another computer?

29
00:01:51,015 --> 00:01:55,170
Well, you can do the same if you wanted
to find a computer on the Internet.

30
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:03,070
Let's go ahead and type 172.217.6.46
into a web browser and hit Enter.

31
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,710
Wait a minute.

32
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,739
What happened?

33
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:07,497
How come we're at Google's homepage?

34
00:02:07,497 --> 00:02:12,503
It turns out the IP address,
172.217.6.46 maps

35
00:02:12,503 --> 00:02:19,543
to Google's homepage through a critical
web protocol, Domain Name System, or DNS.

36
00:02:19,543 --> 00:02:22,496
DNS acts like our Internet's directory and

37
00:02:22,496 --> 00:02:26,520
lets us use human readable
words to map to an IP address.

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,290
The computer doesn't
know what google.com is.

39
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,770
It only knows how to get to an IP address.

40
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,400
With DNS, it's able to map
Google's IP address with google.com.

41
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,470
Every time you go on a website,
your computer is performing a DNS lookup

42
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,540
to find the IP address of
the website name you typed in.

43
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,810
This trick can be a good first step in
diagnosing certain kinds of DNS issues.

44
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:55,000
So if you're able to access
a website by its IP address but

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,610
not its human readable domain name, then
there's a good bet that there's probably

46
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,890
a problem somewhere in the DNS
configuration your network is using.

47
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:07,220
Understanding IP addresses
can come in handy in

48
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,550
all sorts of other situations you might
encounter as an IT support specialist.

49
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,470
The source of Internet requests
are usually identified by IP addresses and

50
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,770
server logs.

51
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:21,350
Many pieces of IT infrastructure need to
have some kind of IP address configuration

52
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,740
applied to them in order to work.

53
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,860
DNS is a huge system, and
we'll be discussing more about it later.

54
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,030
Now that you understand the basics of how
the Internet works, I'll sign off for now,

55
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:36,100
and leave you in the very capable hands
of my friend and colleague, Gian Becuza.

56
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,180
I'll see you again in course two,
The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking.

57
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,780
But in the next lessons,

58
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,580
Gian is going to talk about
the incredible boom of the Internet age.
