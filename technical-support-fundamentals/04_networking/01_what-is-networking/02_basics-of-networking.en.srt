1
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,930
When most people think of the Internet,

2
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,395
they think of a magical cloud that lets you access your favorite websites,

3
00:00:17,395 --> 00:00:21,490
shop online, and you're seemingly endless stream of cat pictures.

4
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,480
But there isn't any magic involved.

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,580
There's no mysterious entity that grants us a cat picture on demand.

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,255
The Internet is just an interconnection of computers around the world,

7
00:00:31,255 --> 00:00:34,765
like a giant spider web that brings all of us together.

8
00:00:34,765 --> 00:00:38,200
We call the interconnection of computers a network.

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,120
Computers in a network can talk to each other and send data to one another.

10
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,630
You can create a simple network with just two computers.

11
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,120
In fact, you might already have your own network

12
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,000
at home connecting all of your home devices.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,100
Let's think on a bigger scale.

14
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,430
What about the computers at your school or workplace?

15
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,500
Are they in a network? They sure are.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,020
All of the computers there are linked together in a network.

17
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,273
Can we link your home,

18
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,990
school and workplace networks together?

19
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,355
We absolutely can.

20
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:11,980
Your workplace connects to a bigger network,

21
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,518
and that network connects to an even bigger network,

22
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:15,583
and on and on.

23
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:19,360
Eventually, you've got billions of computers that are interconnected,

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,940
making up what we call the Internet.

25
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,680
You, like most people,

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,290
probably access the Internet through a browser,

27
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,218
like Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome,

28
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:31,025
Microsoft Edge or something else.

29
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:33,385
This is done through the World Wide Web.

30
00:01:33,385 --> 00:01:38,045
But don't make the mistake of thinking the Internet is the World Wide Web.

31
00:01:38,045 --> 00:01:43,435
The Internet is the physical connection of computers and wires around the world.

32
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:46,818
The Web is the information on the Internet.

33
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:52,930
We use it to access the Internet through a link like www.google.com.

34
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,815
The World Wide Web isn't the only way we can access the Internet.

35
00:01:56,815 --> 00:02:01,945
Your e-mail, chat, and file-sharing programs are also ways you can access the Internet.

36
00:02:01,945 --> 00:02:04,270
In the IT field, managing,

37
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,915
building and designing networks is known as networking.

38
00:02:07,915 --> 00:02:11,508
Networking is a super important and large field in IT.

39
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:14,560
There are specialized jobs, college degree programs,

40
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,865
and tons of literature dedicated entirely to networking.

41
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:19,546
If you work in the IT field,

42
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:23,070
it's super critical that you understand the fundamentals of networking.

43
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,910
So how does it all work?

44
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,285
To answer that question,

45
00:02:26,285 --> 00:02:28,090
we're going to need a lot more time.

46
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:32,235
Fortunately, we have a separate course entirely dedicated to this topic.

47
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,405
We'll only cover the high-level overview of networking here.

48
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:39,340
The Internet is composed of a massive network of satellites,

49
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,940
cellular networks, and physical cables buried beneath the ground.

50
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,400
We don't actually connect to the Internet directly.

51
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,330
Instead, computers called servers connect directly to the Internet.

52
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,055
Servers store the websites that we use,

53
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:55,710
like Wikipedia, Google, Reddit, and BBC.

54
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,315
These websites serve content.

55
00:02:58,315 --> 00:02:59,944
The machines that we use,

56
00:02:59,944 --> 00:03:01,210
like our mobile phones,

57
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:04,960
laptops, video game, consoles and more, are called clients.

58
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,105
Clients request the content,

59
00:03:07,105 --> 00:03:10,225
like pictures, websites, from the servers.

60
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:13,150
Clients don't connect directly to the Internet.

61
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:19,330
Instead, they connect to a network run by an Internet service provider or ISP,

62
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,828
like CenturyLink, Level 3,

63
00:03:21,828 --> 00:03:24,210
Comcast, Telefonica, and things like that.

64
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:27,565
ISPs have already built networks and run

65
00:03:27,565 --> 00:03:30,040
all the necessary physical cabling that connects

66
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,365
millions of computers together in one network.

67
00:03:33,365 --> 00:03:36,980
They also connect to other networks and other ISPs.

68
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,605
These other networks connect to the networks of Google, Reddit, and universities.

69
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:45,505
Basically, all the other networks in the world, together,

70
00:03:45,505 --> 00:03:49,850
they form one giant network of computers called the Internet.

71
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,530
But how do the clients know how to get to servers?

72
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:55,975
Well, how would you send a letter to someone?

73
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:58,600
You'd put your address on the letter and send it

74
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,565
to the address of the person you're sending the letter to.

75
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:04,390
Computers have addresses just like houses.

76
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,720
Computers on a network have an identifier called an IP address.

77
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,720
An IP address is composed of digits and numbers like 100.1.4.3.

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,345
When we want to access a website like www.coursera.com,

79
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:26,609
we're actually going to their IP address like 172.217.6.46.

80
00:04:26,609 --> 00:04:29,050
Devices that can connect to a network have

81
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:32,170
another unique identifier called a MAC address.

82
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:37,060
MAC addresses are generally permanent and hard-coded onto a device.

83
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,330
A sample MAC address can be something like this.

84
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,794
When you send or receive data through a network,

85
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:47,230
you need to have both an IP and a MAC address.

86
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,901
You might be wondering why we need to have two different numbers to identify something.

87
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:56,095
That's a good question. Think again of the letter analogy we used before.

88
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,945
An IP address is your house address,

89
00:04:58,945 --> 00:05:02,720
while the MAC address is the name of this recipient of the letter.

90
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,615
He want to make sure your letter gets to the right location and to the right person.

91
00:05:07,615 --> 00:05:11,410
A more simplified example of the letter delivery would go like this.

92
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,993
I'm in New York City,

93
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:16,570
and I got a letter that I want to send to a friend, Mey.

94
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,105
Mey is halfway across the world in Tokyo.

95
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:22,595
So our letter will go through lots of places before it reaches her.

96
00:05:22,595 --> 00:05:24,430
I put her name and address on there,

97
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:26,985
and I also put my name and address on there too.

98
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:29,245
When I drop my letter off at the post office,

99
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,820
the mail person looks at it.

100
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,268
He thinks, "I don't know how to get to Tokyo from here,

101
00:05:33,268 --> 00:05:35,650
but there is a truck that's headed to Texas."

102
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,090
He puts my letter in that truck.

103
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,585
At the post office in Texas,

104
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:40,615
a mail person looks at the letter and says,

105
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:42,740
"I don't know how to get to Tokyo from here,

106
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,420
but we have a truck going to San Francisco."

107
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,600
She puts my letter in that truck.

108
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,315
At the post office in San Francisco,

109
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,220
yet another mail person looks at my letter.

110
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,310
He says, "Oh, there's a plane headed to Tokyo."

111
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,410
And puts the letter on that plane.

112
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,180
When it finally reaches Tokyo,

113
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,410
the postman there says,

114
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,185
"Oh, I know where Mey lives," and delivers the letter to her.

115
00:06:03,185 --> 00:06:07,405
Obviously, there are many more nuance to mail delivery than what I described,

116
00:06:07,405 --> 00:06:11,860
but this process is similar to how information gets routed across the Internet.

117
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,330
One thing to call out is that data that is

118
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,990
sent through a network is sent through packets.

119
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,098
There are little bits of data,

120
00:06:19,098 --> 00:06:21,775
and you guessed it, ones and zeros.

121
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:23,725
It doesn't matter if it's pictures,

122
00:06:23,725 --> 00:06:25,930
email, music, or text.

123
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,625
When we move data through the network,

124
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,890
we break them down into packets.

125
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,425
When a packet gets to its destination,

126
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:34,960
it will rearrange itself back in order.

127
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,855
Think of a packet like a letter.

128
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:39,670
Let's actually look at this process again, but this time,

129
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,415
we'll use IP addresses and MAC addresses.

130
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:48,261
Natalie has a computer with IP address 113.8.81.2,

131
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:52,435
and she wants to go to google.com and search for pictures of cats.

132
00:06:52,435 --> 00:06:54,490
Before she does that, her computer has to send

133
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,720
a packet to ask google.com if it can access their website.

134
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,420
Our packet knows google.com's IP address is 172.217.6.46,

135
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,510
but it doesn't know how to get there just yet.

136
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,725
The packet travels from one place to another at each destination,

137
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:13,045
where it asks, "Hey,

138
00:07:13,045 --> 00:07:15,130
do you know where google.com is?"

139
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,040
Eventually, it will be routed to another destination that can

140
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,095
get the packet closer and closer to google.com.

141
00:07:21,095 --> 00:07:26,055
Once it reaches a destination that can deliver the packet to a server at google.com,

142
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:28,525
Google will send Natalie a packet saying

143
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:31,685
she can access an unlimited number of cat pictures.

144
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:35,140
There are many technical details that we left out in this explanation, but don't worry.

145
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,560
You'll learn all about the nitty-gritty in the networking course of this program.

146
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,000
For now, this is what you need to know about the not so magic of the Internet.
