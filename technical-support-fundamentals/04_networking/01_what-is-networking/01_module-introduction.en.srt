00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,420
Hi, my name is Victor Escobedo,

2
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,610
and I'm a corporate operations engineer.

3
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,770
I'm excited to spend the next few lessons with you,

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,166
before my colleague and friend,

5
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:24,135
Geon, takes the reins and wraps up the rest of the lessons on the Internet.

6
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:25,325
Before we dive in though,

7
00:00:25,325 --> 00:00:27,635
I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself.

8
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:30,815
My passion for I.T. began way back when I was nine years old,

9
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:33,075
and my dad brought home our first computer.

10
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,270
He was a mechanical engineer and started using

11
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,670
the computer to help him with his CAD work.

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,860
This was the first time I was exposed to computers,

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:43,850
and later realized you can install new software on it, including computer games.

14
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,305
As I tinkered with the computer,

15
00:00:45,305 --> 00:00:46,805
surely to my dad's dismay,

16
00:00:46,805 --> 00:00:49,820
I became more and more interested in how it worked

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,020
and eventually started to open up the case and peek inside.

18
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,690
I found pieces that could be removed and even some that shouldn't,

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,895
learning through trial and error along the way.

20
00:00:58,895 --> 00:01:00,785
I couldn't really explain what it was,

21
00:01:00,785 --> 00:01:04,745
but I just found the mechanics of how it all worked together so fascinating.

22
00:01:04,745 --> 00:01:08,060
Looking back, these were the seeds that inspired my career.

23
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,995
But you see where I grew up,

24
00:01:09,995 --> 00:01:12,320
going to college and pursuing a career,

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,245
wasn't exactly talked about or heavily encouraged.

26
00:01:15,245 --> 00:01:17,600
I'm a first generation Mexican-American and there

27
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,920
weren't a lot of people I knew pursuing a career in tech.

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,195
My friends and family were mostly worrying about

29
00:01:23,195 --> 00:01:25,755
graduating high school and making sure they had jobs,

30
00:01:25,755 --> 00:01:27,835
not really thinking about careers.

31
00:01:27,835 --> 00:01:31,025
My school didn't have the resources to offer many technical classes,

32
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:34,115
and even though my father was working in mechanical engineering,

33
00:01:34,115 --> 00:01:35,615
computers were a tool to him,

34
00:01:35,615 --> 00:01:38,840
like a mill, ruler, or a hammer.

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,870
My parents encouraged me to work hard and pursue computers but

36
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,420
they couldn't really give advice about college or a career in tech.

37
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,715
To no real fault of their own,

38
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:49,310
they just didn't have the necessary experience.

39
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:50,825
When I decided to go to college,

40
00:01:50,825 --> 00:01:54,170
I decided to try my hand at computer science since it could

41
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:58,125
feed my curiosity for how computers worked at a more fundamental level.

42
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,730
I realized that having this foundational knowledge really allowed me to

43
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:05,885
understand some of the higher level concepts that were important in a career in tech.

44
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:08,515
So, while in school I took on my first I.T.

45
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:10,340
job for a local small company.

46
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,770
I've been working in I.T. now for 12 years,

47
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,195
with the last seven years being here at Google.

48
00:02:15,195 --> 00:02:18,050
I now work on managing deployments of large internal I.T.

49
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,146
projects for the company,

50
00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:22,310
applying the knowledge I picked up over the years in my initial I.T.

51
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:27,155
help desk roles, to make sure that I understand how I'm impacting our users,

52
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:28,695
and various support teams.

53
00:02:28,695 --> 00:02:30,480
Now that you know a little bit about me,

54
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,593
let's dig in to the Internet.

55
00:02:32,593 --> 00:02:37,550
The Internet made it possible for us to connect with almost anyone in the world.

56
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:40,700
Before the Internet, you had to use paper maps

57
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:44,360
and write down step by step directions to get where you wanted to go.

58
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,965
If you wanted to see what your friends were up to,

59
00:02:46,965 --> 00:02:48,230
you'd have to call them,

60
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,015
actually talk to them.

61
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:52,100
If you wanted to learn something new,

62
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:56,445
you had to go to a library and hope they have a book on the subject you wanted to learn.

63
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:59,120
People didn't really discover new restaurants unless

64
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,600
they heard about it from someone else or it was advertised.

65
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,635
There was no Yelp or other website that rates restaurants like we have today.

66
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:10,270
For some of us, life without the internet seems unimaginable.

67
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:13,620
We get it, it's become an integral part of our lives.

68
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,900
In the next few lessons,

69
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,975
you'll be learning about what the Internet is,

70
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:19,430
how it came to be,

71
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:24,000
and how it has impacted us both in negative and positive ways.
