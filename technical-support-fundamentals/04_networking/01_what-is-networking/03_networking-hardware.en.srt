1
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,050
Now that we understand what networks are,

2
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,120
let's talk about how they're connected.

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,270
There are a lot of ways you can connect computers to a network.

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,270
We'll only cover a few of the major ones in this course.

5
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,736
First, there is an Ethernet cable,

6
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:28,225
which lets you physically connect to the network through a cable.

7
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:31,003
On the back of the desktop we worked in the previous lessons,

8
00:00:31,003 --> 00:00:34,810
there's a network port that you plug your Ethernet cable into.

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:37,435
Another way to connect to a network is through Wi-Fi,

10
00:00:37,435 --> 00:00:39,355
which is wireless networking.

11
00:00:39,355 --> 00:00:43,795
Most modern computing systems have wireless capabilities like mobile phones,

12
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:45,940
smart televisions and laptops.

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,390
We connect to wireless networks through radios and antennas.

14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,980
The last method will go over uses fiber optic cables to connect to a network.

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:55,780
This is the most expensive method since

16
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:59,530
fiber optic cables allow greater speeds than all the other methods.

17
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,420
Fiber optic gets its name,

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,030
because the cables contain glass fibers that

19
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,540
move data through light instead of electricity.

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,970
This means that we send ones and zeros

21
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,505
through a beam of light instead of an electrical current,

22
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:13,900
through a copper wire.

23
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,149
How cool is that?

24
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:17,905
But our cables have to connect to something.

25
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:20,380
We don't just have millions of cables going in and out

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,857
of computers to connect them together,

27
00:01:22,857 --> 00:01:24,640
instead, computers connect to

28
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,210
a few different devices that help organize our network together.

29
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,345
The first device that your computer connects to is a router.

30
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:36,265
A router connects lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic.

31
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:38,950
Let's say we have four computers, A, B,

32
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,020
C and D, connected together through a router in the same network.

33
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,315
You want to send a file from Computer A to Computer B.

34
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:52,585
Our packets go through the router and the router utilizes network protocols,

35
00:01:52,585 --> 00:01:54,980
to help determine where to send the packet.

36
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:57,385
We'll cover network protocols in the next video.

37
00:01:57,385 --> 00:02:00,235
For now, just know that our router uses a set

38
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:03,840
of rules to figure out where to send our data.

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,935
So, now our packet gets routed from Computer A to Computer B.

40
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:12,940
What if you wanted to send a packet to a computer not in our network?

41
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,480
What if we wanted to send a packet to our friend Alejandro's computer.

42
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,675
Alejandro is on a different network altogether.

43
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:24,230
Fortunately, our router knows how to handle that too.

44
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,525
The packet will get routed outsider network to our ISP's network.

45
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:33,565
Using networking protocols, it's able to figure out where Alejandro's computer is.

46
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:36,440
During this process, our packet is traveling

47
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,910
across many different routers switches and hubs.

48
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,410
Switches and hubs are also devices that help our data travel.

49
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,945
Think of switches like mailrooms in a building.

50
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:49,526
Routers get our letters to the building.

51
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:50,965
But once we're inside,

52
00:02:50,965 --> 00:02:54,355
we use the mailroom to figure out where to send a letter.

53
00:02:54,355 --> 00:02:56,870
Hubs are like company memos.

54
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:59,020
They don't know who to send the memo to,

55
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,565
so they send it to everyone.

56
00:03:00,565 --> 00:03:03,385
Working with network devices is important to understand,

57
00:03:03,385 --> 00:03:05,650
because it's likely that one day you'll have

58
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,245
users reporting problems accessing the Internet.

59
00:03:08,245 --> 00:03:11,230
You want to investigate your way up the network stack.

60
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:15,400
A technologies stack, in this case a network stack is

61
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,035
just a set of hardware or software that provides the infrastructure for a computer.

62
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:25,060
So, the networks stack is all the components that makes up computer networking.

63
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,805
You might need to investigate the networks stack and your job.

64
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:31,795
You'd start with making sure the end user computers are working properly.

65
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:36,070
Then you'd turn your attention to other possible points of failure like the cabling,

66
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,740
switches and routers, that work together to access the Internet.

67
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,525
We'll dive a little deeper into

68
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:44,105
the different networking devices in the Networking course.

69
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:46,960
For now, let's route ourself to the next lesson,

70
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,330
the language of the Internet.
