1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,030
The added convenience made possible by the Internet also

2
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:18,225
makes it harder and harder for us to maintain anonymity.

3
00:00:18,225 --> 00:00:19,893
When you purchase something online,

4
00:00:19,893 --> 00:00:21,870
your buying habits can be logged,

5
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:23,730
and you may be targeting with marketing.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,605
Even when you want to do something simple,

7
00:00:25,605 --> 00:00:27,240
like book a dinner reservation,

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,490
your name, phone number, email,

9
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:32,160
and maybe even a credit card number are required.

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,890
Now think about the information you post publicly.

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,425
Name, pictures, family, friends,

12
00:00:37,425 --> 00:00:38,760
and even your location,

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,725
may be available to anyone online.

14
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:42,990
Be aware of what you're sharing by reviewing

15
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,655
the privacy policy of a service before you use it.

16
00:00:45,655 --> 00:00:48,270
It's up to you to decide if the trade-offs of

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,010
a service are worth sharing your personal information.

18
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,405
In most cases, companies are trying to build great products that make our lives easier.

19
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:59,190
They may offer their products for free because you provide them with free data.

20
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,610
Just make sure your information won't fall into the wrong hands.

21
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,670
Privacy doesn't just affect us on a personal scale,

22
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,890
it's also become a concern for governments.

23
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,160
In Europe, data regulation and privacy are strictly

24
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,380
protected to help EU citizens gain more control over their personal information.

25
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,175
COPPA, or the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act,

26
00:01:20,175 --> 00:01:24,420
also regulates the information we show to children under the age of 13.

27
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,625
There are many more examples of government regulation of privacy.

28
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:31,225
It's no longer something we can think of on an individual scale.

29
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:35,400
Another concern that's grown with the rise of the Internet is the issue of copyright.

30
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,715
Imagine you create a beautiful graphic and upload it on the web for your friends to see.

31
00:01:39,715 --> 00:01:42,135
Then some random stranger takes your graphic,

32
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:43,575
claims it as their own,

33
00:01:43,575 --> 00:01:45,120
and sells it for profit.

34
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,110
Thankfully, several companies have been founded and designed specifically

35
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,950
to help solve this issue of copyright and intellectual property theft.

36
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,260
There are also efforts in place that you've learned about,

37
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,880
like open source projects,

38
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,915
that benefit from being on the Internet.

39
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:02,665
In these cases, open collaboration allows the project to thrive.

40
00:02:02,665 --> 00:02:05,250
On top of privacy and copyright considerations,

41
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,680
computer security is another issue that you

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,005
may face in both your personal and professional life.

43
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:14,690
More and more companies are being targeted in cyber security attacks.

44
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,940
For example, the WannaCry Attack that started in Europe,

45
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,465
infected hundreds of thousands of computers across the world.

46
00:02:21,465 --> 00:02:26,130
The financial loss of that attack has been estimated at over a billion dollars.

47
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:28,425
Hospital computers were even infected.

48
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:31,710
In a critical life threatening moment, every second matters.

49
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,485
Not being able to perform basic medical duties,

50
00:02:34,485 --> 00:02:35,985
like pulling medical records,

51
00:02:35,985 --> 00:02:41,195
took time away from doctors and nurses and more importantly the lives of their patients.

52
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:42,645
Before the WannaCry Attack,

53
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:45,005
there were lots of other world wide attacks.

54
00:02:45,005 --> 00:02:49,080
In 2011, the Sony PlayStation network was attacked and

55
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,625
around 77 million user accounts had personal information exposed,

56
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:56,550
everything from entire governments to businesses that

57
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,780
handle the data of millions of people have been compromised.

58
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,035
Computer security is no longer the job of specialized security engineers,

59
00:03:04,035 --> 00:03:08,505
it's everyone's responsibility, and as an IT support specialist,

60
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:12,715
you'll need to have a fundamental understanding of computer security.

61
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:16,005
You'll get to learn these fundamentals in the course IT Security,

62
00:03:16,005 --> 00:03:19,410
Defense Against the Digital Dark Arts, which I'll be teaching you.

63
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,620
I spend every day working in security.

64
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,010
I love working in the field,

65
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,780
because I get to help protect people and their devices from all over the globe.

66
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,075
The security course in this program teaches you just that.

67
00:03:30,075 --> 00:03:32,880
You'll also learn what threats are out there and how you can

68
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,325
prevent and mitigate them and how to secure your workplace.

69
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:38,420
Next up, you're going to meet my buddy,

70
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:41,700
Phelan Vendeville, who's going to introduce you to software.

71
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,075
But before that we've got a quick quiz we've

72
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:47,280
cooked up for you on all the topics we've covered so far.

73
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,000
Take your time, and good luck.
