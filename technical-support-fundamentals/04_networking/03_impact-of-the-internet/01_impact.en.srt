1
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,515
There's no doubt that the Internet has made it much

2
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,325
easier for us to connect with our friends and family.

3
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:20,905
But it's also made it easier to connect with everyone else in the world.

4
00:00:20,905 --> 00:00:23,515
We're no longer confined to our local neighborhoods.

5
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:28,135
Decades ago, If you wanted to sell something you'd place your goods in your driveway,

6
00:00:28,135 --> 00:00:30,655
and put up signs for a garage sale.

7
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,710
The only way someone would see this is if

8
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:35,465
they drove by your neighborhood and saw your sign.

9
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:39,620
We got a little more savvy and started advertising in our local newspaper.

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,350
We had to pay to list our ad,

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,830
but at least we were able to reach more people in our neighborhood.

12
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,450
Then the Internet boom happened,

13
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,110
and we could use sites like Craigslist to post an advertisement for free,

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,315
and reach more people in our city.

15
00:00:52,315 --> 00:00:55,540
Then we were able to sell to people outside of our city,

16
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,610
to cities in other states.

17
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,790
Eventually, we could sell to people outside of our own country,

18
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:02,350
all thanks to the Internet.

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:05,905
Globalization is the movement that lets governments, businesses,

20
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:10,920
and organizations communicate and integrate together on an international scale.

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,010
It's been made possible by the Internet and information technology.

22
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,925
Countries can communicate with each other faster.

23
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:22,225
News happening on the other side of the world reaches us before we can blink.

24
00:01:22,225 --> 00:01:26,295
And global and financial trade have increased dramatically.

25
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:31,360
Globalization has transformed almost every aspect of human society as we know it.

26
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,040
Media and social movements have become globalized too.

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,810
In 2011, several countries in the Middle East

28
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,960
started riots and protests against their government regimes,

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,210
known as the Arab Spring protests.

30
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,215
Because of outlets like social media,

31
00:01:45,215 --> 00:01:48,430
their movement gained worldwide attention and citizens of

32
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,075
many different countries banded together to take collective action.

33
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:55,495
Social media movements like this have been going on for years,

34
00:01:55,495 --> 00:02:00,785
gathering together people from all over the world and unifying them under a single cause.

35
00:02:00,785 --> 00:02:04,750
The Internet has also dramatically changed the way we consume entertainment.

36
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,225
A few years ago if you wanted to watch something on TV you had to

37
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:12,690
actually sit in front of your TV right when it aired, or else you'd miss it.

38
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,830
Then we started recording our shows,

39
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,515
first on VHS and then on things like TiVo,

40
00:02:17,515 --> 00:02:19,095
so we could watch them later.

41
00:02:19,095 --> 00:02:22,540
But now, we have access to more TV shows and movies than

42
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,180
we can ever watch in our entire lifetime right under fingertips.

43
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,680
What if you wanted to listen to a new song by your favorite band?

44
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,680
You used to have to wait until they released their album in a store,

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,490
and you couldn't just buy one song,

46
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,760
you had to buy the entire album on a CD,

47
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,200
cassette tape, or even a vinyl record back in the day.

48
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,460
If you wanted to get the day's news you had to

49
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,495
wait until the next day when the newspaper would print it.

50
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:48,160
Even then you weren't able to get a fraction of

51
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,420
a fraction of a fraction of the news you can get on the Internet today.

52
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,105
Retail stores aren't the only place you look when you want to buy something anymore.

53
00:02:57,105 --> 00:02:59,170
Now you can order food, clothes,

54
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,305
books, and while just about anything on the Internet.

55
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:04,910
But you don't just buy stuff off the web,

56
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,120
you can even get an education.

57
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,580
Colleges and universities worldwide are taking

58
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:13,540
education out of the classroom and putting it into your homes.

59
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,660
Online courses are becoming a popular way for people to get

60
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:21,115
a quality education at a more convenient location, time, and price.

61
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:22,665
And it's not just degrees,

62
00:03:22,665 --> 00:03:27,760
there's an almost infinite amount of educational tools available on the Internet.

63
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,920
A few years ago, all this information on

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,040
the internet had to be reached through your laptop or desktop.

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,285
Now more than ever,

66
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:38,980
people are going mobile and can access all of this information with their smartphones.

67
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,015
It's truly an amazing time to be alive in this technological age.

68
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:48,970
So, the takeaway here is that the only constant in the field of technology is change.

69
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,580
And as an IT support specialist you'll have to stay on

70
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,000
your toes to keep up with this dynamic shifting landscape.
