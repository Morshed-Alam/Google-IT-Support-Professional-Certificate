00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,435
You may have heard of the phrase Internet of Things or IoT.

2
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:21,810
This concept is pretty new but already has a major impact on the future of computing.

3
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,520
The concept is fairly simple.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,950
Basically, more and more devices are

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,605
being connected to the internet in a smarter fashion.

6
00:00:28,605 --> 00:00:31,230
Did you know that there are now smart thermostats?

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,583
Instead of manually programming them when you'll be out of the house,

8
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:38,180
they'll just know when you leave and turn off the air conditioning for you.

9
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,585
And it's not just your thermostat,

10
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:44,450
many companies out there are making smarter household devices.

11
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,445
There are fridges that can keep track of what foods you have in their,

12
00:00:47,445 --> 00:00:50,040
toasters that can be controlled by your smartphone,

13
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,650
lights that can change depending on your mood and

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,615
cars that drive you instead of you driving them.

15
00:00:55,615 --> 00:00:57,465
The world is moving towards connecting

16
00:00:57,465 --> 00:01:00,955
manual devices to the internet and making them smarter.

17
00:01:00,955 --> 00:01:04,020
These decisions have many societal implications though,

18
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:07,785
especially when it comes to cybersecurity or personal privacy.

19
00:01:07,785 --> 00:01:10,440
But there's also a huge potential for IoT to

20
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:14,220
completely transforme the world in ways we have yet to see.

21
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,975
In the future, people may be shocked to learn that we had to do manual things like,

22
00:01:18,975 --> 00:01:22,205
make your own coffee or drive to the grocery store.

23
00:01:22,205 --> 00:01:25,980
While you may not experience working with an Internet of Things device,

24
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:30,030
you should be aware that it will become a large part of the future of computing.

25
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,330
