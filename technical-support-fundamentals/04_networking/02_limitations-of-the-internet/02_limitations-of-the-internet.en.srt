1
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,270
We've mentioned IP addresses a lot in

2
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:17,825
this course but we haven't actually gone into detail about them.

3
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:20,575
They are actually different versions of IP addresses.

4
00:00:20,575 --> 00:00:24,840
The current Protocol, Internet Protocol version four or IPv4

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,800
is an address that consists of 32 bits separated into four groups.

6
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,045
Remember, 42 bits is four bytes and one byte can be stored

7
00:00:35,045 --> 00:00:39,660
up to 256 values from 0 to 255.

8
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,250
So IPv4 addresses, can be something like 73.55.242.3.

9
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:50,685
Even though it might seem like a lot of possible IPv4 addresses,

10
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:54,425
there are less than 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses.

11
00:00:54,425 --> 00:00:58,520
There are way more than 4.3 billion websites out on the web today.

12
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,585
Some IPv4 addresses are even reserved for special purposes.

13
00:01:02,585 --> 00:01:05,870
So, the number of usable IP addresses is even less.

14
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:08,000
A device that wants to connect to the internet,

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,160
needs to have an IP address but

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,335
devices around the world have already exceeded those numbers.

17
00:01:13,335 --> 00:01:15,965
So, where have we been getting IP addresses?

18
00:01:15,965 --> 00:01:20,125
IP addresses have been able to keep up with the amount of devices in the world,

19
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:24,890
thanks to IPv6 or Internet Protocol version six addresses.

20
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,440
IPv6 addresses consist of a 128 bits,

21
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,285
four times the amount that IPv4 uses.

22
00:01:32,285 --> 00:01:35,480
Which means way more devices can have IP addresses.

23
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,780
The adoption of IPv6 addresses has been slow but steady.

24
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:43,900
Eventually, you will start seeing more and more IPv6 addresses in the wild.

25
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,720
An example IPv4 for address can be something like 172.14.24.1.

26
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:55,220
But an IPv6 address can be something like what you see here,

27
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,780
quite a bit of a difference, don't you think?

28
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,305
Here's an analogy for how big this difference is between IPv4 and IPv6.

29
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:09,330
With IPv6 there are 2 to the 128 power possible IP addresses,

30
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,190
2 to the 128 power is an insanely huge number.

31
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:18,500
So huge, that scientists had trouble describing with words just how big this number is.

32
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,015
So, here's an analogy.

33
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,555
Think of a grain of sand,

34
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:23,165
if you scoop up a handful,

35
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:25,875
do you know how many grains you have in your hand?

36
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:29,975
Probably a lot but that is not even close to the number we are talking about.

37
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:34,205
Now, take all the grains of sand in the entire world,

38
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:36,785
assuming there are roughly 7 and a half

39
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:40,245
times 10 to the 18th power grains of sand in the world.

40
00:02:40,245 --> 00:02:43,880
That still would not be enough IPv6 addresses.

41
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,240
Now, let us take all the sand from multiple earths,

42
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,750
now you are close to what that number would be.

43
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,820
It is a crazy large number.

44
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,970
Just know that we will not be running out of IPv6 addresses anytime soon.

45
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,820
Another mitigation tool that we have been able to use

46
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:02,210
is NET or Network Address Translation.

47
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,770
This lets organizations use

48
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,420
one public IP address and many private IP addresses within the network.

49
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,160
Think of NET like a receptionist at a company.

50
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,395
You know what number to dial to get to the company and once you reach the receptionist,

51
00:03:15,395 --> 00:03:19,370
he can transfer your call to one of the private numbers inside the company.

52
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:23,135
Now, instead of companies using hundreds of public IP addresses,

53
00:03:23,135 --> 00:03:25,120
they can just use one IP address.

54
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,875
Remember the routers we talked about earlier?

55
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:30,290
One task you might need to perform when you are an I.T.

56
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:33,500
support specialist, is to configure NET on a router to

57
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,340
facilitate communication between your company's network and the outside world.

58
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,455
There are lots of other limitations that we have had to deal with.

59
00:03:40,455 --> 00:03:42,995
You'll learn more about them in the networking course.

60
00:03:42,995 --> 00:03:47,180
For now, you should have a general understanding of why IPv4 is

61
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,490
so limiting for us today and how IPv6 helped solve that.
